# Validation Rule SQL — Plain-English Guide

**Last updated: 2026-09-14** — XFER-04 and XFER-07 re-anchored to the delivery date after the
data-analyst review of the transfer SQL.

> A companion to [`validation-tests.md`](validation-tests.md). That file lists *what* each rule
> checks; **this file explains the *SQL* behind each rule** — line by line, in plain English, so a
> non-technical reader can understand exactly what the query does, which tables and columns it
> touches, and why it is written the way it is.

## How to read this guide

Each rule is documented with the same six parts:

1. **Header** — the rule number and the friendly error-type name you see in the Exceptions
   Workbench.
2. **At a glance** — severity, SLA, who owns it, and where its tickets are filed.
3. **The SQL** — shown in up to two versions, side by side:
   - **Catalog SQL** — the clean, documented version shown in the Admin → Rule editor. It is the
     reference definition of the rule.
   - **Live finder SQL** — the query that actually runs each day inside `bq_finder.py` and creates
     the exceptions you see in the app. For some rules this is identical to the catalog version;
     for others it differs (and we explain why). A few catalog rules are **not wired into the live
     finder yet** — those are clearly marked.
4. **Plain-English walkthrough** — the query explained one piece at a time, no SQL knowledge assumed.
5. **Tables & columns used** — every table and key column the query touches, what each column means
   in business terms, and — where the query joins two tables — which columns join and *why*.
6. **Example of a flagged record** — a concrete (anonymized) example of a row this rule would catch.

**A note on tables.** All inventory rules read from the data warehouse
`wonder-dw-prod-brd.inventory`. The two tables you'll see most often:

| Friendly name | Real table | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **The Inventory Ledger** | `consolidated_inventory_ledger` | One row per inventory *movement* — every receipt, transfer, adjustment, waste, correction, etc. This is the system's running diary of what happened to inventory. |
| **The PO Table** | `int_ledger_purchase_orders` | One row per purchase-order line — what we *ordered* from a supplier, how much, at what price, and how much has been received. |

**Severity & SLA** (full definitions in [`validation-tests.md`](validation-tests.md)):

| Severity | SLA (business days) |
|---|---|
| **Urgent** | 0 — same day |
| **High** | 1 day |
| **Medium** | 2 days |
| **Low** | 3–5 days |

| **Live status** | ✅ **Live — runs in the daily validation job, and it fires.** Identifying receipts by their movement action surfaces a real, ongoing problem: **Fishbowl / facility CK1** receipts land with both `ref_order_type` and the PO number blank (~13 in the last 30 days; 16–40/month for the past 8 months). The prior version keyed on `ref_order_type = 'Purchase Order'` and matched **0 rows in all of history** — it was watching the wrong column and missed every one of these. The filter covers both receipt actions — `'PO Receipt'` (Fishbowl/Extensiv/Shiphero/RMX) and Pantry's `'Received'` — so every source system's receipts are checked. |

### The SQL

The two versions below do **the same check** — they differ only in plumbing. The catalog version is
the plain-English-friendly statement of the rule; the live version is what the daily job actually
runs and is what you see in the Admin → Rule editor.

#### Catalog SQL (the documented definition)

```sql
-- A PO-receipt row (identified by its movement action) that carries no PO id (ref_order_id NULL/blank).
DECLARE run_date DATE DEFAULT DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY);

SELECT
  id,
  datetime_utc,
  facility_name,
  system_of_origin,
  l1_action,
  l2_action,
  consumable_sku,
  item_name,
  ref_order_type,
  ref_order_id
FROM `wonder-dw-prod-brd.inventory.consolidated_inventory_ledger`
WHERE (l2_action = 'PO Receipt' OR (l2_action = 'Received' AND system_of_origin = 'Pantry'))
  AND (ref_order_id IS NULL OR TRIM(ref_order_id) = '')
  AND DATE(datetime_utc) = run_date
ORDER BY datetime_utc DESC
```

#### Live finder SQL (what runs daily)

```sql
-- A PO-order-type receiving row in the ledger with a NULL/blank PO number (safety-net).
DECLARE run_date DATE DEFAULT DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY);  -- daily batch target = the just-closed day (yesterday PST in prod)

WITH flagged AS (
  SELECT CAST(id AS STRING) AS id, ANY_VALUE(facility_name) AS facility,
         ANY_VALUE(system_of_origin) AS system, ANY_VALUE(consumable_sku) AS consumable_sku,
         ANY_VALUE(item_name) AS item_name, ANY_VALUE(l1_action) AS l1_action,
         ANY_VALUE(l2_action) AS l2_action, ANY_VALUE(ref_order_type) AS ref_order_type,
         MIN(datetime_utc) AS datetime_utc
  FROM `wonder-dw-prod-brd.inventory.consolidated_inventory_ledger`
  WHERE (l2_action = 'PO Receipt' OR (l2_action = 'Received' AND system_of_origin = 'Pantry'))
    AND (ref_order_id IS NULL OR TRIM(ref_order_id) = '') AND DATE(datetime_utc) = run_date
  GROUP BY id),
ranked AS (SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER() AS total_matches, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY datetime_utc DESC) AS rn FROM flagged)
SELECT * EXCEPT(rn) FROM ranked WHERE rn <= 500 ORDER BY datetime_utc DESC
```

### Plain-English walkthrough

Both SQL blocks above run the **same check** — the catalog version is the short, readable statement
of the rule, and the live version adds the production "plumbing" the daily job needs. The
walkthrough below explains the **live version**, since that's what actually runs; it covers
everything in the catalog version along the way.

**First, how the query is shaped.** SQL lets you build a result in named *steps* using the form
`WITH <name> AS ( … )`. Think of each step as a labeled scratch list that the next step can reuse.
This query has two steps — one named **`flagged`** and one named **`ranked`** — followed by a final
line that picks the rows to keep. Reading it as *"build a list called `flagged`, then a list called
`ranked`, then choose from `ranked`"* is exactly right. (`AS` just means "name this step.")

**The run date.** `DECLARE run_date … = yesterday` defines the day we're checking. `CURRENT_DATE()`
is today and `DATE_SUB(…, INTERVAL 1 DAY)` subtracts a day, so **`run_date` = yesterday**. The daily
job always checks the previous, fully-closed day, because today's data is still arriving.

**Step 1 — `flagged`: find the problem rows.** This step builds the list of offending receipts.
- `FROM … consolidated_inventory_ledger` — look in the **Inventory Ledger** (one row per inventory movement).
- `WHERE (l2_action = 'PO Receipt' OR (l2_action = 'Received' AND system_of_origin = 'Pantry'))` — keep only **purchase-order receipts** (inventory arriving because we bought it), identified by the **movement action**. We deliberately key on the *action* and not on `ref_order_type = 'Purchase Order'`: on exactly the broken rows this rule exists to catch, `ref_order_type` is itself blank, so keying on it would let those receipts slip through. The movement action stays populated even when the reference fields don't. Two action labels are in play across the source systems — `'PO Receipt'` (Fishbowl, Extensiv, Shiphero, RMX) and `'Received'` (Pantry) — so we cover both. The `'Received'` arm is **scoped to Pantry** on purpose: a different source, `system_of_origin = 'System'`, also emits `'Received'` for internal negative-quantity depletion/reversal entries that are almost never PO-linked, and pulling those in would flood this Urgent queue with false positives.
- `AND (ref_order_id IS NULL OR TRIM(ref_order_id) = '')` — **the heart of the rule**: of those, keep only the ones whose **PO number is missing** — either truly empty (`IS NULL`) or only blank spaces (`TRIM(…) = ''`, where `TRIM` strips spaces so `"   "` counts as empty).
- `AND DATE(datetime_utc) = run_date` — and only ones that happened **yesterday**.
- `GROUP BY id` — collapse the result to **one row per ledger record** (`id` is each record's unique number), so a bad receipt is listed once, not repeatedly.
- `SELECT CAST(id AS STRING) AS id, ANY_VALUE(facility_name) AS facility, …` — for each bad record, grab the details a person needs to fix it: the facility, source system, item, the kind of movement, and when it happened. Two bits of housekeeping: `CAST(id AS STRING)` just means "treat the id as text," and `ANY_VALUE(…)` means "since we've grouped to one row, give me that row's value for this column."

So after Step 1, **`flagged`** is a clean, de-duplicated list of yesterday's blank-PO receipts.

**Step 2 — `ranked`: number them, newest first.** This step takes the `flagged` list and adds two
helper columns:
- `COUNT(*) OVER() AS total_matches` — count **all** the matches and stamp that total onto every row, so the app can say *"showing 500 of 1,200"* even when it only displays some.
- `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY datetime_utc DESC) AS rn` — sort the rows newest-first and number them 1, 2, 3, … in a column called `rn` ("row number"). Row 1 is the most recent.

**Final line — keep the newest 500.** `SELECT * EXCEPT(rn) FROM ranked WHERE rn <= 500 ORDER BY
datetime_utc DESC` does three things: keep only rows numbered **500 or lower** — a **safety cap** so
one bad-data day can never create more than 500 tickets and flood the queue; drop the helper `rn`
column from the output (`EXCEPT(rn)` means "every column except this one"); and present what's left
**newest-first**. On a normal day there are far fewer than 500 matches — currently on the order of a
handful per week (the Fishbowl / CK1 blank-PO receipts).

### Tables & columns used

**Table:** The Inventory Ledger — `wonder-dw-prod-brd.inventory.consolidated_inventory_ledger`

| Column | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `l2_action` | The movement's sub-action (e.g. *PO Receipt*, *Received*, *Transfer Out*). | **Filter** — keep `PO Receipt` rows, plus `Received` rows from Pantry (identifies a PO receipt by its action). |
| `system_of_origin` (in filter) | The upstream system the record came from. | **Filter** — scopes the `Received` arm to Pantry, excluding `System`-origin depletion/reversal noise. |
| `ref_order_id` | The purchase-order number the receipt belongs to. | **The check** — flag when this is null or blank. |
| `datetime_utc` | Exact UTC timestamp of the movement. | **Filter** — keep only yesterday; also sort newest-first. |
| `id` | Unique id for the Inventory Ledger row. | Identifies the exact record to fix; used as the ticket fingerprint. |
| `facility_name` | Which facility recorded the movement. | Triage — tells the owner *where* it happened. |
| `system_of_origin` | The upstream system the record came from (Pantry / Ship Hero / Fishbowl / Extensiv / RMX). | Triage — points to where the data was entered. |
| `ref_order_type` | What kind of order the movement relates to (e.g. *Purchase Order*). | Context/snapshot only — on the flagged rows this is typically **blank**, which is why the rule keys on `l2_action` instead. |
| `l1_action` | The movement's action category (e.g. *Add*). | Context — what kind of movement this was. |
| `consumable_sku` | The item identifier (SKU) involved. | Triage — *what* item came in. |
| `item_name` | Human-readable item name. | Triage — the item in plain words. |

### Example of a flagged record (real)

> This is a **real** row the rule catches on live data (Fishbowl / CK1, recorded 2026-07-13). It is a
> PO receipt — the movement action says so — but it arrived with **both** the PO number *and* the
> `ref_order_type` blank, which is exactly why the rule keys on `l2_action` rather than `ref_order_type`.

| Column | Value |
|---|---|
| `id` | `1c13ad9a6689c9b34a567d2936c7a4d9` |
| `datetime_utc` | `2026-07-13 13:53:39 UTC` |
| `facility_name` | `CK1` |
| `system_of_origin` | `Fishbowl` |
| `l1_action` / `l2_action` | `Add` / `PO Receipt` |
| `consumable_sku` | `5001001` |
| `item_name` | `Red Pepper Flakes, Crushed, Bulk` |
| `ref_order_type` | *(blank)* ← why keying on `ref_order_type = 'Purchase Order'` missed it |
| `ref_order_id` | *(blank)* ← **the problem** |

**Why it's flagged:** its movement action marks it a purchase-order receipt, but with no PO number we
can't match it to what was ordered, can't validate quantity or price, and can't close out the PO —
hence the **Urgent** severity and same-day SLA.

> **Coverage note (for the data team).** Two receipt-action labels are in play across the source
> systems: `'PO Receipt'` (Fishbowl, Extensiv, Shiphero, RMX) and `'Received'` (Pantry, ≈22k rows in
> the last 30 days, all currently carrying a PO number). The filter covers both, but scopes the
> `'Received'` arm to **Pantry** — `system_of_origin = 'Pantry'`. That scope is deliberate: a separate
> source, `system_of_origin = 'System'`, *also* emits `l2_action = 'Received'`, but for **internal
> negative-quantity depletion/reversal entries** that are almost never PO-linked (2 of 437 rows over
> 90 days carried a PO). Those are not purchase-order receipts, so including them would generate ~40
> false-positive Urgent tickets a month. If `'System'` is ever confirmed to be a real receiving flow
> that *should* carry PO numbers, drop the Pantry scope to bring it in. There is also a rare Pantry
> variant, `'Received with Other Quality Issue'`; it's not in the filter — reopen this note if it ever
> starts arriving with blank PO numbers.

### 📝 Change note — for data-analyst sign-off (Jonny Li)

> **Status: awaiting sign-off.** This documents a July 2026 refinement of PO-03. It reflects Jonny's
> two directions — (1) re-base off the **IMS SKU** rather than the translated *consumable* SKU, and
> (2) make it a **two-way match** (the PO's own receipt count *and* the ledger cumulative) — plus two
> deviations from the literal instruction that the live data forced (see ⚠️ below).

**What changed**

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| **Item key / grain** | `consumable_sku` (a downstream translation) | **`ims_sku`** (raw id on both tables); one ticket per `(PO, IMS SKU)` |
| **Signals** | one — ledger receipts vs ordered | **two** — Layer 1: PO's own `received_qty` vs `ims_sku_qty` (packaging); Layer 2: ledger `SUM(ims_quantity_change)` vs `consumable_sku_qty` (base) |
| **Flag condition** | ledger over by >30% (or UoM mismatch) | **either** layer over by >30% (or UoM mismatch) |
| **Threshold** | 30% High / 100% Urgent | unchanged (30% / 100%) |

**Why — evidence from live prod data**

1. **Consumable was the noise source, not the base unit.** Keeping the same base-unit comparison but
   re-keying it from `consumable_sku` to `ims_sku` dropped the over-receipt count **≈109 → ≈34** on a
   recent 45-day window — the translation was fanning one order across rows. This is Jonny's exact
   point, confirmed.
2. **The two layers genuinely diverge, in one direction.** Over ~2,281 recently-touched pairs, every
   PO-books over-receipt is *also* a ledger over-receipt (PO-only = 0), and the ledger catches extra
   **ledger-only** cases where the PO's own count looks clean — the case the single-signal rule missed
   (see the `PO 61920` Roncadin example below).

**⚠️ Two deviations from the literal instruction, both data-forced**

The instruction was to use IMS quantities on both sides. On the ledger that isn't fully viable, so
**Layer 2 splits its two jobs across two different ledger columns**:

- **Deciding whether a pair is over** (the `led_received` total compared to `consumable_sku_qty`) sums
  `ims_quantity_change`, not `consumable_quantity_change`. An earlier pass used
  `consumable_quantity_change` for this total; Jonny's follow-up flagged that basis as over-flagging on
  live data, so the received total now runs on `ims_quantity_change` instead.
- **Timestamping when it started** (the `breach` CTE's running total, used only to find the first
  receipt that crossed the threshold) still sums `consumable_quantity_change`. That's a lower-stakes use
  — pinpointing *when* the total crossed the line, not deciding *whether* it did — where the two
  columns' ~90% agreement is good enough.
- Ledger `ims_quantity_change` is stored in the **base** unit — it equals `consumable_quantity_change`
  ~90% of rows, and for the same IMS SKU the ledger's `ims_uom` matches the PO's `ims_uom` only ~5% of
  the time. So it still can't be compared to PO `ims_sku_qty` (Layer 1's packaging-unit benchmark) —
  it stays a Layer 2 (base-unit) measure, just a different base-unit column than originally documented.
- Ledger `supplier_quantity_change` *is* in packaging units but is **NULL for 100% of Pantry
  receipts** (the largest receiving flow), so it can't be used universally either.

*Confirmed live — this is the column the finder SQL actually runs on (see below).*

### At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Rule number** | PO-03 |
| **Rule type** | `RANGE` (a "the value must stay within an expected range" check — here, received vs ordered), evaluated as a **two-way match** |
| **Grain** | **One ticket per (PO, IMS SKU)** — was per (PO, consumable SKU). |
| **Severity** | **Banded by how far over:** 30–99% over → **High** (a supply-chain signal, e.g. an over-shipment); ≥100% over (received ≥ 2× ordered) → **Urgent** (a likely receiving error like a double-scan). A pure unit-of-measure mismatch (neither layer over) is split off as its own error type (`PO_UOM_MISMATCH`). |

| **Live status** | 🟢 **Live — runs daily.** Flagged **0** on 2026-07-13 (no over-receipts booked that day); a 14-day backfill window catches **5**, all confirmed by *both* layers. It fires whenever a PO's own receipts **or** its ledger cumulative cross the over-receipt threshold. |

### Why two layers — and why IMS, not consumable

The two tables record receiving in **different units**, and this is the crux of the refinement:

- The **PO table** books both what was ordered (`ims_sku_qty`) and its own running received count
  (`received_qty`) in the **vendor packaging unit** — cases, packs, eaches (`cs` / `pk` / `ea`).
- The **inventory ledger** books each movement in the **base/consumable unit** — ounces, pounds,
  grams. Confirmed on live data: `ims_quantity_change` on the ledger equals `consumable_quantity_change`
  ~90% of the time (both base units), and for the *same* IMS SKU the ledger's `ims_uom` matches the
  PO's `ims_uom` only ~5% of the time. So the ledger's "IMS quantity" is **not** in the PO's IMS
  packaging unit — comparing them directly would produce nonsense (e.g. 50 cases ordered vs 8,400 oz
  received → a fake 168× "over-receipt"). It's still a base-unit column, though, so it can stand in
  for `consumable_quantity_change` as Layer 2's received total (see the ⚠️ note above for why it does).

So each layer is measured **entirely within its own unit system**, never across the base↔packaging
boundary:

| Layer | Ordered | Received | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 · PO's own books** | `ims_sku_qty` | `received_qty` | packaging (`cs`/`pk`/`ea`) — one table, no conversion |
| **2 · Ledger cumulative** | `consumable_sku_qty` | `SUM(ims_quantity_change)` | base (`oz`/`lb`/`g`) — the only cross-system-reliable ledger measure |

Layer 2's received total sums `ims_quantity_change` (per Jonny's follow-up — `consumable_quantity_change`
over-flagged on live data) rather than the ledger's `supplier_quantity_change`, which *is* in packaging
units but is **NULL for every Pantry receipt** (the largest receiving flow) and so can't be used
universally. `consumable_quantity_change` still drives the breach-date calculation (see the ⚠️ note).

### Plain-English walkthrough

This is the most involved rule, because "did we receive too much?" is now asked **two ways at once**,
each in its own unit. The live query builds the answer in named steps (`WITH <name> AS ( … )`); read
it as a short pipeline. Both SQL blocks do the same job; the catalog version is the simpler
documented form, and the **live version's thresholds are the ones actually in force** (30% / 100%).

1. **`run_date` = yesterday** — the day we're checking.

2. **`evt` — pull the receipt history for the (PO, IMS SKU) pairs that moved yesterday.** First it
   finds every `(po, ims_sku)` that *received something yesterday* (the small `JOIN (… DATE(datetime_utc)
   = run_date …)` sub-query) — we only re-examine orders that actually had activity, which keeps the
   query cheap. For each, it pulls **every** ledger line tied to that PO+IMS-SKU over the last **30
   days** and adds a **running cumulative total** (`running_recv`, off `consumable_quantity_change`) in
   **base units** — row by row in time order, "how much have we received against this PO+item *so
   far*." This running total only feeds the **breach date** below; it isn't the column the flag decision
   runs on (see step 3). Why include positive **and** negative lines? Because if a receiver over-logs a
   receipt and a correction is later booked back against the same PO, the two cancel out — so the
   running total is a **true net**, and we don't flag a mistake that was already fixed.

3. **`received` — Layer 2's bottom line.** Collapses `evt` to one row per `(po, ims_sku)` with the
   **net ledger received quantity** — `SUM(q)`, where `q` is `ims_quantity_change` (base units, see the
   ⚠️ note above for why this column and not `consumable_quantity_change`) — and its unit, plus triage
   details (facility, system, the dominant receiving action).

4. **`ordered` — what the PO called for, in *both* units, plus its own count.** From the **PO Table**,
   per `(po, ims_sku)`: `ordered_pkg` (= `SUM(ims_sku_qty)`, packaging), `ordered_base`
   (= `SUM(consumable_sku_qty)`, base), and **`po_received`** (= `SUM(received_qty)`, the PO's own
   running received count in packaging units — this is **Layer 1**), plus supplier and status.

5. **`breach` — when the problem started.** For each pair it finds the **first** receipt at which the
   ledger running total crossed the over-receipt line, and the first receipt that introduced a wrong
   unit. This gives the exception an accurate "as of" date instead of just "today."

6. **`flagged` — apply the two-way test.** Joins received ↔ ordered ↔ breach and computes both layers:
   - **`po_over`** = `po_received > ordered_pkg × 1.30` (the PO's own books, packaging units).
   - **`led_over`** = `led_received > ordered_base × 1.30` (the ledger cumulative, base units).
   A row is kept if **either** layer is over, *or* the received unit doesn't match the ordered unit.
   `over_frac` is the **worse** of the two layers' overage fractions and decides the severity band.

7. **`ranked` + final line — fair capping.** Rows are numbered *within each band* (pure UoM mismatch /
   30–99% over / ≥100% over) so the **500-row daily cap** keeps all populations represented rather than
   letting the most extreme rows crowd out the rest. The final line drops the helper number and sorts
   worst-first.

**What the ticket tells you.** Each exception records a plain-English **`match`** verdict — one of:
*"Confirmed by both the PO's own receipts and the ledger cumulative"*; *"PO receipt appears correct
(matched the order); the ledger over-counted — likely a duplicate or erroneous ledger entry.
Investigate the ledger, not the receiving"*; or *"The PO's own received_qty is over-ordered; the
ledger cumulative is within range"* — plus a cross-check line showing the other layer's numbers.

**Ledger-only case (Check 1 clean, Check 2 over).** When the PO's own receipt count matches the order
but the ledger cumulative is over, the receiving was almost certainly right and the **ledger** is the
one that's wrong. Those tickets get the "investigate the ledger" verdict above and a machine flag
(`likely_ledger_error`) so the dashboard can group them (routing is unchanged — still Field Ops). The
live query also computes `same_qty_receipts` / `dup_receipts` — a count of identical `'Add'` receipts
booked against the same PO+item — and when it's **≥ 2** the verdict appends *"N identical receipts
detected (probable double-booking)"*, the classic signature of the same receipt logged twice.

**How the join works & why it's needed:** the ledger and the PO table are stitched together on
**`ledger.ref_order_id = PO.po`** (same purchase order) **and** **`ledger.ims_sku = PO.ims_sku`**
(same item, by the *raw* system id) — see the `USING (po, ims_sku)` joins. Without the join we'd only
know what we *received*; we need the PO table to know what was *ordered* — and its own receipt count —
so we can run both layers of the match.

### Tables & columns used

**Tables:** Inventory Ledger (`consolidated_inventory_ledger`) **⋈** PO Table (`int_ledger_purchase_orders`).
**Join keys:** `ref_order_id` ⇄ `po` (the purchase order) and **`ims_sku` ⇄ `ims_sku`** (the item, by raw system id).

| Column (table) | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `ims_sku` (both) | The raw item id the source systems stamp on both tables. | **Join key & grain** — the item link, replacing the translated `consumable_sku`. |
| `ref_order_id` (ledger) | The PO a receipt belongs to. | **Join key** to the PO table; identifies the order. |
| `ims_quantity_change` (ledger) | How much the item moved on that line, in **base units** (+ in, − out). | **Summed** into the Layer-2 net received quantity (`led_received`) — decides `led_over`. |
| `consumable_quantity_change` (ledger) | Same movement, in base units, from a different source column. | Drives the `running_recv` cumulative used **only** for the breach date — not the flag decision (see ⚠️ note above). |
| `consumable_uom` (ledger) | The base unit the receipt was booked in. | Compared to the PO's base unit (UoM-mismatch check). |
| `datetime_utc` (ledger) | When the movement happened. | Picks "touched yesterday", the 30-day window, and the breach date. |
| `received_qty` (PO) | The PO's **own** running received count, in **packaging units**. | **Layer 1 numerator** — the "PO receipt" signal. |
| `ims_sku_qty` (PO) | Quantity ordered, in **packaging units** (= `supplier_sku_qty`). | **Layer 1 benchmark** — `received_qty` is compared against this. |
| `consumable_sku_qty` (PO) | Quantity ordered, in **base units**. | **Layer 2 benchmark** — the ledger cumulative is compared against this. |
| `ims_uom` / `consumable_uom` (PO) | Packaging unit / base unit the item was ordered in. | Displayed on the ticket; base unit drives the UoM-mismatch check. |
| `supplier_name`, `status` (PO) | Vendor and PO status. | Triage context on the ticket. |
| `facility_name` / `facility_type` (ledger) | Where it was received. | Triage + routing (HDR vs CK/Production). |

### Examples of flagged records (from live data)

**Both layers agree — a clear over-receipt.** `VDC 4312` / IMS `4200136-2` (*Pico de Gallo Salsa*,
Shiphero): ordered **1**, but the PO's own books show **334 received** and the ledger cumulative shows
**302,604 g against 906 g ordered** — both far past the ≥100% line, so **Urgent**. Verdict: *"Confirmed
by both the PO's own receipts and the ledger cumulative."*

**Ledger-only — the two-way match earning its keep.** `PO 61920` / IMS `8807623` (*Pizza, Cheese, 10"*,
Roncadin):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `po` / `ims_sku` | `PO 61920` / `8807623` |
| Layer 1 (PO's own books) | received **1,620** of **1,620** ordered — **within range** ✅ |
| Layer 2 (ledger cumulative) | received **27,540 ea** of **1,620 ea** ordered → **+1,600% over** ❌ |
| `match` | *Ledger cumulative over-received; the PO's own received_qty is still within range (possible reconciliation gap).* |

**Why it matters:** the PO's own receipt count looks perfectly clean (1,620 of 1,620), so the *old*
single-signal rule would have **missed** it. The ledger, however, booked **17× the quantity** the PO
acknowledges — a genuine reconciliation gap between the warehouse ledger and the buying system that is
exactly what the second layer exists to surface.

> convert the vendor's unit** (e.g. a *case*) into **the unit we actually use** (e.g. *each* or
> *grams*) — either the item isn't in the catalog at all, or the vendor we bought it from isn't
> linked to it — so a receipt can't be turned into the right on-hand quantity.

### The new table: the supply-chain product catalog

This is the first rule to read `wonder-dw-prod-brd.**supply_chain_catalog.wonder_products**` — a
**view** (~765 rows / ~534 products) that is the master **unit-of-measure / packaging catalog** for
**Wonder-family products**. Each row is one *(product × packaging level)* and carries the conversion
factors (`level_1..4_conversion_factor`, `cumulative_conversion_factor`, `base_uom` /
`base_uom_quantity`) that translate a vendor pack → the consumable base unit, plus three SKU
identities that let us tie the PO's SKUs to it:

| Catalog column | Is the… | Ties to PO column |
|---|---|---|
| `hdr_product_sku` (e.g. `4000315`) | Consumable / HDR SKU | **`consumable_sku`** ✅ the join key |
| `vendor_product_skus[]` / `priority_vendor_product_sku` | Vendor SKU(s) | **`supplier_sku`** ✅ the link check |
| `wonder_product_sku` (e.g. `W4200042`) | internal Wonder SKU | *(not `wonder_sku` — different ID namespace, not used)* |

**Important:** the catalog's conversion factors are **100% populated** (there are *no* rows with a
null/zero factor). So "missing unit conversion" is **not** a blank-field problem inside the catalog —
it is a **coverage / linkage gap**: an item is being *purchased* but the catalog can't resolve its
*(Consumable SKU, Vendor SKU)* to a conversion at all. That happens two ways, both flagged:
1. **No catalog record** — the consumable has no row in `wonder_products`.
2. **Vendor not linked** — the consumable *is* in the catalog, but the PO's vendor SKU isn't among
   that product's linked vendor SKUs, so we don't know which packaging conversion applies to it.

### Plain-English walkthrough

The rule stitches the **PO Table** (what we bought, from whom, in what unit) to the **product
catalog** (the master unit conversions) and keeps the purchases the catalog can't resolve.

1. **`run_date` = yesterday** — the day we're checking (the daily job always checks the last fully-closed day).

2. **`cat` — boil the catalog down to one row per product.** Group the catalog by `hdr_product_sku`
   (the consumable/HDR SKU) and collect, for each product, **all** of its linked vendor SKUs (the
   `vendor_product_skus` arrays concatenated, plus the `priority_vendor_product_sku`). This is the
   reference list: *"for this consumable, here are the vendor SKUs we know how to convert."*

3. **`po` — the purchases worth checking, de-duplicated.** From the PO Table keep only:
   - `order_type = 'Purchase'` — actual purchases.
   - **Wonder-family items only** — `ims_sku_type` is `WSKU` or `Pack SKU`, *or* the consumable SKU is
     in the `40xxxxx` family. This deliberately **excludes raw vendor goods** that were never meant to
     have a Wonder conversion, so the rule doesn't flag the entire purchasing universe. It also
     **excludes the `9xxxxxx` smallwares/packaging family** (cups, containers, box liners from Uline /
     Ed Don) — those are operational supplies that never live in the food product catalog, so flagging
     them would only create permanent, un-closeable tickets.
   - `consumable_uom != supplier_uom` — **a conversion is only *needed* when the units differ** (bought
     by the case, used by the each/gram). If the units already match, there's nothing to convert.
   - Then collapse to **one row per (consumable_sku, supplier_sku)** so the same vendor-item isn't
     re-flagged for every PO line, keeping a sample PO and count for triage.

4. **`flagged` — apply the test.** `LEFT JOIN` each purchase to the catalog on
   **`consumable_sku = hdr_product_sku`** and keep it only if **either**: there's **no catalog row**
   (`c.hdr IS NULL`), **or** there is one but the **PO's vendor SKU isn't in that product's linked
   vendor SKUs**. Both mean the same thing operationally — we can't convert this vendor's pack into the
   consumable unit. `missing_record` records which of the two it was, for the ticket.

5. **`ranked` + final line — cap.** Stamp the total match count on every row, order most-recently-
   purchased first, keep the first 500, drop the helper column.

**How the join works & why it's needed:** the two tables meet on **`PO.consumable_sku =
catalog.hdr_product_sku`** (the same item) and then the **vendor** side is checked with
`supplier_sku IN UNNEST(vendor_product_skus)` (is this vendor linked?). We need *both* tables because
the PO knows *what we bought and from whom* but not *how to convert it*; the catalog knows the
conversion but only for the SKUs it has on file. (Note: `PO.wonder_sku` is an `8xxxxxx`-series number
in a **different ID namespace** than the catalog's `W42xxxxx` `wonder_product_sku`, so it is *not* a
valid join key and isn't used.)

**Auto-close:** each day the rule re-checks every open PO-06 ticket and closes it once the catalog
resolves that pair — a record now exists **and** the vendor SKU is linked.

### Tables & columns used

**Tables:** PO Table (`int_ledger_purchase_orders`) **⋈** Product catalog (`supply_chain_catalog.wonder_products`).
**Join keys:** `consumable_sku` ⇄ `hdr_product_sku` (the item); `supplier_sku` ∈ `vendor_product_skus` / `priority_vendor_product_sku` (the vendor link).

| Column (table) | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `consumable_sku` (PO) | The consumable/HDR item number. | **Join key** to the catalog; part of the ticket identity. |
| `supplier_sku` (PO) | The vendor's item number we bought. | **The link check** — must be a linked vendor SKU for this product. |
| `consumable_uom` / `supplier_uom` (PO) | The consumable unit vs the vendor's unit. | **Scope** — only checked when they differ (a conversion is needed). |
| `ims_sku_type` (PO) | Whether the line is a WSKU / Pack SKU / Vendor SKU. | **Scope** — limits the rule to Wonder-family items. |
| `order_type` (PO) | Purchase vs Transfer. | **Filter** — purchases only. |
| `po_date_utc` (PO) | The PO's date. | **Filter** — yesterday (daily) / lookback window (backfill); age anchor. |
| `hdr_product_sku` (catalog) | The product's consumable/HDR SKU. | **Join key** — matched to `consumable_sku`. |
| `vendor_product_skus[]`, `priority_vendor_product_sku` (catalog) | The vendor SKUs linked to the product. | **The reference** — the set the PO's `supplier_sku` must be in. |
| `cumulative_conversion_factor`, `base_uom` (catalog) | The actual unit conversion. | The value that becomes unusable when the linkage is missing. |
| `wonder_product_name` (catalog) | Human-readable product name. | Triage — shown when the item is in the catalog. |

### Example of a flagged record (from live data)

A pair caught by the 30-day backfill, routed to Procurement:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `consumable_sku` / `item_name` | `4001221F` / `Chicken Sandwich Filet FZN (15 ea)` |
| `supplier_sku` | `1142589-EA` |
| `supplier_name` | `US Foods Inc` |
| `consumable_uom` ← `supplier_uom` | `ea` ← `cs` (bought by the case, used by the each) |
| `gap` | **Vendor SKU not linked to this consumable in the catalog** |

**Why it's flagged:** the product *is* in the catalog, but the vendor SKU we actually bought
(`1142589-EA`, US Foods) isn't linked to it — so there's no conversion telling us how many *eaches* a
*case* of `1142589-EA` yields. Every receipt against it lands in the wrong on-hand quantity until
Procurement links the vendor SKU (or adds the catalog record), hence the **Urgent** severity.

```

### Plain-English walkthrough

This rule reads a single table (the **PO Table**) and rolls every PO line up to **one row per PO**,
so the whole order is judged together — not each line separately.

1. **`run_date` = yesterday.**

2. **`po_agg` — summarise each PO.** Group all of a PO's lines and compute:
   - `total_received` = the sum of received quantity across **every** line. A PO only counts as
     "nothing received" when this is exactly **0** — so a partially-received order is *not* caught here
     (that's PO-08).
   - `has_open_line` = is any line still **Open**? If yes, the order is still awaiting receipt and
     hasn't been cancelled or closed.
   - `expected_date` = the latest expected date **among the still-open lines** — the schedule for the
     part that hasn't arrived.

3. **`flagged` — keep the stuck POs.** Keep a PO only when **all** are true:
   - `total_received = 0` — nothing received at all.
   - `has_open_line` — still open (so, by definition, **not cancelled and not closed**).
   - `expected_date < run_date − 2 days` — more than the 2-day grace past due.
   - `expected_date >= run_date − 7 days` — the **recency window**: only POs that came due in the last
     week, so the first rollout is a small, current batch instead of years of backlog. Set the
     `..._lookback_days` setting to 0 to switch this off and sweep the full backlog (e.g. at go-live).
   - `breach_date` (expected + 2 days) is stamped on the ticket as the age/SLA anchor; `days_overdue`
     is shown for triage.

4. **`ranked` + final line — cap.** Stamp the total match count on every row, order oldest-expected
   first (most overdue surface first), keep the first 500, drop the helper column.

**Auto-close:** each day the rule re-checks every open PO-07 ticket and closes it once the PO has a
receipt, or Supply Chain cancels/closes it.

### Tables & columns used

**Table:** PO Table — `int_ledger_purchase_orders`. **Joins:** none (single-table, grouped by PO).

| Column | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `received_qty` | How much has been received on the line. | **The check** — summed per PO; must be 0. |
| `status` | The PO line's lifecycle status. | **The check** — at least one line must be `Open`. |
| `expected_date` | When the line was due to be received. | **The check** — must be >2 days (and ≤7 days) before yesterday. |
| `order_type` | Purchase vs Transfer. | **Filter** — purchases only. |
| `consumable_sku_qty` | Ordered quantity (consumable units). | Context (ordered qty) shown on the ticket. |
| `po`, `destination_name`, `supplier_name` | PO number, facility, vendor. | Triage context on the ticket. |

### Example of a flagged record (from the dashboard)

A live exception opened by the 2026-07-06 run — **Jira KAN-1041**, routed to Procurement:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `po` | `FB-8991` |
| `supplier_name` | `Baldor Specialty Foods` |
| `facility` | `CK1` |
| `po_status` | `Open` ← still open, not cancelled |
| `expected_date` | `2026-06-29` |
| `days_overdue` | `7` ← **the problem** |
| `received_qty` | `0` |

**Why it's flagged:** the PO was due 2026-06-29, nothing has been received, and it's still Open (not
cancelled) 7 days later — Procurement needs to chase the delivery or cancel the order.

```

### Plain-English walkthrough

Like PO-07, this reads only the **PO Table** and rolls each PO up to **one row**, judging the whole
order together. The difference is *what* it looks for: a **partial** receipt that never got closed.

1. **`run_date` = yesterday.**

2. **`po_agg` — summarise each PO.** For every PO, sum `received_qty` and `supplier_sku_qty` across all
   its lines (both in supplier units), record whether it's `not_closed` (any line still in a
   non-terminal status), and take the expected date of the not-yet-closed lines.

3. **`flagged` — keep the stuck partials.** Keep a PO only when **all** are true:
   - `total_received > 0` — **something** was received (this is what separates it from PO-07).
   - `total_received < total_ordered − 0.001` — but it's **short of what was ordered** (by even 1; the
     tiny `0.001` just absorbs floating-point noise).
   - `not_closed` — Supply Chain hasn't closed or cancelled it, so the shortfall is still outstanding.
   - `expected_date < run_date − 3 days` — more than the 3-day grace past due.
   - `expected_date >= run_date − 7 days` — the same **recency window** as PO-07 (set the lookback
     setting to 0 to sweep the full backlog).
   - `shortfall_qty` (ordered − received) and `days_overdue` are stamped on the ticket for triage;
     `breach_date` (expected + 3 days) is the age/SLA anchor.

4. **`ranked` + final line — cap.** Same as the other rules: count, order oldest-expected first, keep
   the first 500.

**Auto-close:** each day the rule re-checks every open PO-08 ticket and closes it once the PO is fully
received (received ≥ ordered) or Supply Chain closes/cancels it.

### Tables & columns used

**Table:** PO Table — `int_ledger_purchase_orders`. **Joins:** none (single-table, grouped by PO).

| Column | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `received_qty` | How much has been received (supplier units). | **The check** — summed per PO; must be > 0 but < ordered. |
| `supplier_sku_qty` | How much was ordered from the vendor (supplier units). | **The check** — the ordered total to compare against. |
| `status` | The PO line's lifecycle status. | **The check** — at least one line must be non-terminal (not closed/cancelled). |
| `expected_date` | When the line was due to be received. | **The check** — must be >3 days (and ≤7 days) before yesterday. |
| `order_type` | Purchase vs Transfer. | **Filter** — purchases only. |
| `po`, `destination_name`, `supplier_name` | PO number, facility, vendor. | Triage context on the ticket. |

### Example of a flagged record (from the dashboard)

A live exception opened by the 2026-07-06 run — **Jira KAN-1043**, routed to Procurement:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `po` | `s-20260629-1` |
| `supplier_name` | `Ed Don` |
| `po_status` | `PENDING` ← not closed |
| `expected_date` | `2026-06-30` |
| `days_overdue` | `6` |
| `ordered_qty` | `200` |
| `received_qty` | `198` |
| `shortfall_qty` | `2` ← **the problem** |

**Why it's flagged:** 198 of 200 were received, leaving 2 outstanding, and 6 days past the expected
date the PO still hasn't been closed — Procurement needs to receive the balance or close it short.

  FROM flagged
)

SELECT * EXCEPT (rn)
FROM ranked
WHERE rn <= 500
ORDER BY po_date_utc DESC
```

### Plain-English walkthrough

This rule reads a single table (the **PO Table**) — there's no join, because we're checking a field
on the purchase order itself, not comparing it to anything.

1. **`run_date` = yesterday.**

2. **`flagged` — find PO lines with no price.** From the PO Table, keep a line only when **all** of
   these are true:
   - `order_type = 'Purchase'` — it's an actual purchase (not a transfer).
   - `supplier_price IS NULL OR supplier_price = 0` — **the check**: the vendor price is blank *or*
     zero. Either way there's no real price to cost the receipt with.
   - `supplier_sku IS NOT NULL` — it's a real vendor line (ignore placeholder rows).
   - `UPPER(status) = 'CLOSED'` — **only closed POs.** An open PO might still get its price filled in
     before it's finalized, so flagging it early would be noise; once a PO is *closed* with no price,
     that's a genuine problem. (`UPPER(…)` just makes the match case-insensitive, so "Closed" and
     "CLOSED" both count.)
   - `DATE(po_date_utc) = run_date` — limit to POs dated yesterday (the daily batch).
   - `GROUP BY po, supplier_sku` — one row per PO line. `MIN(supplier_price)` is just a way to pull
     the single price value out after grouping.

3. **`ranked` + final line — count and cap.** Same plumbing as the other rules: stamp the total match
   count on every row, number them newest-first, keep the newest 500, drop the helper column.

### Tables & columns used

**Table:** PO Table — `int_ledger_purchase_orders`. **Joins:** none (single-table check).

| Column | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `supplier_price` | The vendor's price for the line. | **The check** — flag when null or 0. |
| `order_type` | Purchase vs Transfer. | **Filter** — purchases only. |
| `status` | The PO's lifecycle status. | **Filter** — closed POs only. |
| `po_date_utc` | The PO's date. | **Filter** — yesterday; also sorts newest-first. |
| `supplier_sku` | The vendor's item number. | Identifies the line; must be present. |
| `po`, `supplier_name`, `supplier_sku_name` | PO number, vendor, item name. | Triage context on the ticket. |

### Example of a flagged record (from the dashboard)

A live exception currently open in the Workbench — **ERR-00058** (Jira **KAN-907**), routed to
Procurement:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `po` | `VDC 4569` |
| `supplier_sku` / `supplier_sku_name` | `1347821` / `Tikka Sauce, Monsoon Kitchen (Staged) [Pouch, 340g]` |
| `supplier_name` | `US Foods Inc` |
| `supplier_price` | `$0.00` ← **the problem** |
| `po_date_utc` | `2026-06-09` |

**Why it's flagged:** the closed PO line carries no vendor price, so any receipt against it values at
$0 — understating inventory and COGS until Procurement sets the real vendor price.

### The SQL

#### Catalog SQL (the documented definition)

```sql
-- Framework PO-11: a ledger 'Correction' transaction (l1_action LIKE '%correct%') with a
-- NULL/blank correction_ref_id — the correcting entry doesn't reference what it fixes.
SELECT
  id,
  datetime_utc,
  facility_name,
  system_of_origin,
  l1_action,
  l2_action,
  consumable_sku,
  item_name,
  correction_ref_id
FROM `wonder-dw-prod-brd.inventory.consolidated_inventory_ledger`
WHERE LOWER(l1_action) LIKE '%correct%'
  AND (correction_ref_id IS NULL OR TRIM(correction_ref_id) = '')
```

#### Live finder SQL (what runs daily)

```sql
-- Ledger 'Correction' transaction (l1_action LIKE '%correct%') with no correction_ref_id
-- (framework PO-11), last 7 days. One row per ledger event.
DECLARE run_date DATE DEFAULT DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 DAY);  -- yesterday

WITH flagged AS (
  SELECT
    CAST(id AS STRING)          AS id,

    AND DATE(datetime_utc) <= run_date
    AND DATE(datetime_utc) > DATE_SUB(run_date, INTERVAL 7 DAY)   -- last 7 days incl. run_date
  GROUP BY id
),

ORDER BY datetime_utc DESC
```

### Plain-English walkthrough

This rule reads a single table — the **Inventory Ledger** — and checks one field on correction
transactions. No join: we're validating the correcting row against itself.

1. **`run_date` = yesterday.**

2. **`flagged` — find unreferenced corrections.** Keep a ledger row only when **all** are true:
   - `LOWER(l1_action) LIKE '%correct%'` — **the action filter**: the transaction's top-level action
     mentions "correct" (today that's `Correction`, e.g. *Correct Input Error*). `LOWER(…)` makes it
     case-insensitive, and the `%…%` wildcards catch "Correction", "Corrected", etc.
   - `correction_ref_id IS NULL OR TRIM(...) = ''` — **the check**: the correction carries no reference
     to the original transaction it's fixing.
   - `DATE(datetime_utc)` is within the **last 7 days** (up to and including `run_date`) — the recency
     window that keeps the first rollout small; the ledger is date-partitioned, so this also makes the
     query cheap. Widen `po_correction_missing_ref_lookback_days` to sweep more history.
   - `GROUP BY id` — one row per ledger transaction (`id` is the row's unique key); `ANY_VALUE`/`MIN`
     just pull the display fields out after grouping.

3. **`ranked` + final line — cap.** Stamp the total match count on every row, number them newest-first,
   keep the newest 500, drop the helper column.

**Auto-close:** each day the rule re-checks every open PO-11 ticket and closes it once that ledger
row's `correction_ref_id` has been populated.

### Tables & columns used

**Table:** The Inventory Ledger — `consolidated_inventory_ledger`. **Joins:** none (single-table check).

| Column | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `l1_action` | The transaction's top-level action (Receipt, Adjust, Correction, …). | **Filter** — must contain "correct". |
| `correction_ref_id` | The id of the original transaction this entry corrects. | **The check** — flag when null/blank. |
| `datetime_utc` | When the transaction posted. | **Filter** — last 7 days; also sorts newest-first. |
| `id` | The ledger row's unique key. | Identity — one ticket per row; used to auto-close. |
| `l2_action`, `consumable_sku`, `item_name`, `facility_name`, `system_of_origin` | Sub-action, item, facility, source system. | Triage context on the ticket. |

### Example of a flagged record (from the dashboard)

A live exception opened by the 2026-07-06 run — **Jira KAN-1044**, routed to SC Product (IMS):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `l1_action` / `l2_action` | `Correction` / `Correct Input Error` |
| `correction_ref_id` | *(blank)* ← **the problem** |
| `facility` | `DISH` |
| `consumable_sku` | `4000550` |
| `occurred_at` | `2026-07-06` |

**Why it's flagged:** the ledger records a correction to an input error, but it doesn't reference the
original transaction it corrects — so the fix can't be traced back or reconciled against what went
wrong.

    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY po_date_utc DESC) AS rn
  FROM flagged
)

SELECT * EXCEPT (rn)
FROM ranked
WHERE rn <= 500
```

### Plain-English walkthrough

Same shape and logic as PO-01, but pointed at the **PO master table** instead of the ledger. Single
table, no join — we're just checking whether a field is blank.

1. **`run_date` = yesterday.**

2. **`flagged` — find master rows with no PO number.** From the PO Table, keep a row only when:
   - `order_type = 'Purchase'` — purchases only.
   - `po IS NULL OR TRIM(po) = ''` — **the check**: the PO-number field is empty, or only blank
     spaces (`TRIM` strips spaces so `"   "` counts as empty).
   - `DATE(po_date_utc) = run_date` — dated yesterday.
   - `GROUP BY id` — one row per master record (`_id` is the row's unique key — note the PO table uses
     **`_id`**, whereas the ledger uses `id`; they're different tables with different column names).

3. **`ranked` + final line — count, cap at 500, done.**

### Tables & columns used

**Table:** PO Table — `int_ledger_purchase_orders`. **Joins:** none (single-table check).

| Column | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `po` | The purchase-order number. | **The check** — flag when null or blank. |
| `order_type` | Purchase vs Transfer. | **Filter** — purchases only. |
| `po_date_utc` | The PO's date. | **Filter** — yesterday; also sorts newest-first. |
| `_id` | Unique id for the PO master row. | Identifies the exact broken record to fix. |
| `supplier_name`, `supplier_sku`, `consumable_sku` | Vendor, vendor item, our item. | Triage context — what the orphaned row was for. |

### Example of a flagged record (illustrative)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `_id` | `po_row_55e1a2` |
| `po` | *(blank)* ← **the problem** |
| `supplier_name` | `Sysco` |
| `consumable_sku` | `CSK-100884` |

**Why it's flagged:** a purchase-order master row with no PO number can't be received against or
matched to anything — it's a broken record that points to an upstream ingestion fault, so it's
**Urgent**.

### Plain-English walkthrough

This rule answers: *"we received this item against PO #12345 — but was this item ever actually
ordered on PO #12345?"* That needs both tables: the **ledger** (what was received) and the **PO
table** (what was ordered). It's built in named steps.

1. **`run_date` = yesterday.**

2. **`led` — what got received against POs yesterday.** From the ledger, one row per (PO, item)
   received yesterday, with the net quantity and triage details (facility, system, item name, the
   dominant receiving action, first/last receipt dates).

3. **`po_lines` — how much each (PO, item) actually orders.** For every (PO, item) on a purchase
   order's lines, sum `consumable_sku_qty` to get the **ordered quantity**. Think of this as the guest
   list *with a headcount*: not just "is this item invited," but "how many were ordered."

4. **`po_exists` — which POs are real.** The set of PO numbers that exist at all (plus the supplier).

5. **`flagged` — the match logic (this is the clever part).** Two joins do the work:
   - `JOIN po_exists … USING (po)` — first confirm the **PO is real**. (If the PO itself didn't
     exist, that's a *different* problem — a missing PO, not a wrong item — so we require it to exist
     here.)
   - `LEFT JOIN po_lines … ON po AND consumable_sku` then **`WHERE COALESCE(pl.ordered_qty,0) <= 0`** —
     the `LEFT JOIN` looks the received item up on the PO's lines; if it isn't there, `pl.ordered_qty`
     comes back empty (`NULL`), and `COALESCE(…,0)` turns that into `0`. So the filter keeps receipts
     where the PO orders **zero or none** of the item — covering **both** breaks at once: the item is
     *not on the PO at all* (NULL → 0), **or** it's *on a line ordered for 0*. In plain terms: "the PO
     is real, but it orders none of this item — yet we received it." The zero-order case matters
     because Ship Hero can auto-create a receive-line with order qty 0 for an unexpected item, and if
     nothing was ordered we may never invoice the vendor.

6. **`ranked` + final line — count, cap at 500, newest-first.**

### Tables & columns used

**Tables:** Inventory Ledger (`consolidated_inventory_ledger`) **⋈** PO Table (`int_ledger_purchase_orders`).
**Join keys:** `ref_order_id` ⇄ `po` (the order) and `consumable_sku` ⇄ `consumable_sku` (the item).

| Column (table) | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `ref_order_id` (ledger) | The PO the receipt was booked against. | **Join key** — must exist in the PO table. |
| `consumable_sku` (ledger) | The item that was received. | **The check** — the PO must order a positive quantity of it. |
| `datetime_utc` (ledger) | When it was received. | **Filter** — yesterday; sets the receipt dates. |
| `consumable_quantity_change` (ledger) | Quantity received. | Net received qty shown on the ticket. |
| `po`, `consumable_sku` (PO) | The order's lines (what was ordered). | The "guest list" the received item is matched against. |
| `consumable_sku_qty` (PO) | Quantity ordered on the PO line. | **The check** — summed per (PO, item); `<= 0` (or no line) is a break. |
| `supplier_name` (PO) | Vendor on the PO. | Triage context. |

### Example of a flagged record (from the dashboard)

A live exception currently open in the Workbench — **ERR-00048** (Jira **KAN-897**), routed to
SC Product (IMS):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `po` | `127308375` (exists ✓) |
| `consumable_sku` / `item_name` | `9001847` / `Clamshell, Fred's, Burger Box` |
| On the PO's lines? | **No** ← **the problem** |
| `received_qty` | `800 ea` |
| `supplier` / `facility` | `Ed Don` / `Hackettstown` |
| First → last receipt | `2026-06-11` |

**Why it's flagged:** the PO is valid, but this item was never ordered on it — likely a wrong item
received, an undocumented substitution, or a PO line that was never set up. It needs reconciliation
before the receipt is trusted, hence **High**.

<!-- ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     A note on the two COST rules: both compare items to the ERP standard-cost table.
     COST-01 = the item has NO cost record at all. COST-02 = it HAS one, but it's $0/NULL.
     ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

> **The two cost rules, side by side.** Both check an item against the **ERP standard-cost table**,
> but for opposite failures. **COST-01** fires when the item has **no cost record at all** (it's
> missing from the ERP), so its waste can't be valued. **COST-02** fires when the item **has a cost
> record, but the cost is $0 or blank**, so every dollar figure for it comes out wrong. In SQL terms
> that's the difference between a `LEFT JOIN … WHERE cost IS NULL` (COST-01: no match found) and a
> `JOIN … WHERE cost = 0` (COST-02: match found, but the value is bad).

### Where the standard cost comes from

Both rules need the **official cost of each item**, which doesn't live in the inventory warehouse —
it lives in the **ERP (Microsoft Dynamics)**, a separate system in its own project
(`wonder-raw-prod.erp_prod_batch`). In every cost-rule query, the first step (a slice named `cost`)
builds a clean one-row-per-item price list from the ERP: for each item (`ITEMID`) it takes the
**most recently activated price** at the company's `'control'` costing site and computes a
per-unit cost (`unit_cost = PRICE ÷ PRICEUNIT`). The item is linked to our inventory by matching the
ERP's `ITEMID` to our `consumable_sku`. The `cost` step is **identical in both rules below**, so it's
explained once here and not repeated in each walkthrough.

### Plain-English walkthrough

1. **`run_date` = yesterday.**

2. **`cost` — the ERP price list.** One row per item with its latest standard cost (explained in
   *"Where the standard cost comes from"* above).

3. **`waste` — what was wasted/adjusted yesterday.** From the ledger, keep only **adjustment**
   movements (`l1_action = 'Adjust'`) that represent genuine inventory loss — *excluding* the
   `l2_action`s that are just location moves or admin corrections (`Move From`, `Move To`,
   `Update Received Order`, `Shelf Life Extension`). For each item it sums the **quantity lost**
   (`SUM` of the negative movements, flipped to a positive `waste_qty`).

4. **`flagged` — the items with no cost on file.** A `LEFT JOIN` tries to find each wasted item in the
   `cost` list; **`WHERE c.ITEMID IS NULL`** keeps only the ones where **no cost row was found** — the
   same anti-join trick as PO-14, but here it means "this item isn't set up in the ERP cost table at
   all."

5. **`ranked` + final line — order by biggest loss.** It stamps the total match count on each row and
   sorts by `waste_qty` (largest waste first). Note this rule is **not capped** — every such item is
   surfaced, because each one is a hole in the waste valuation.

### Tables & columns used

**Tables:** Inventory Ledger (`consolidated_inventory_ledger`) **⋈** ERP standard cost
(`wonder-raw-prod.erp_prod_batch.inventitempriceftistaging`). **Join key:** `consumable_sku` ⇄ `ITEMID`.

| Column (table) | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `l1_action` / `l2_action` (ledger) | The movement's action / sub-action. | **Filter** — keep waste adjustments, drop moves & admin corrections. |
| `consumable_quantity_change` (ledger) | How much the item moved (− = loss). | Summed into `waste_qty` (the amount lost). |
| `consumable_sku` (ledger) | The item that was wasted. | **Join key** to the ERP cost list. |
| `ITEMID` (ERP) | The ERP's item id. | **Join key** — its **absence** is the failure. |
| `datetime_utc` (ledger) | When it happened. | **Filter** — yesterday; first/last seen dates. |
| `facility_name` (ledger) | Where the waste occurred. | Triage context. |

### Example of a flagged record (from the dashboard)

A live exception currently open in the Workbench — **ERR-00039** (Jira **KAN-888**), routed to
Accounting:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `consumable_sku` / `item_name` | `5182961` / `Chicken Wonton, FC (Buyout)` |
| `waste_qty` (over the window) | `11,361.21 lb` |
| Cost record in ERP? | **None** ← **the problem** |
| `facility` (type) | `CK1` (Production) |
| First → last seen | `2026-05-30` → `2026-06-12` |

**Why it's flagged:** 11,361 lb of this item was wasted/adjusted over the window, but with no standard
cost on file that waste values at **$0** in every report — silently understating total waste.
Accounting needs to set up a standard cost for the item in Dynamics.

### Plain-English walkthrough

The shape mirrors COST-01, with **one crucial difference in the join** (see below).

1. **`run_date` = yesterday.**

2. **`cost` — the ERP price list.** Identical to COST-01's `cost` step.

3. **`led` — every item active in the ledger yesterday.** Any item that had *any* movement that day
   (not just waste), one row each.

4. **`flagged` — items whose cost exists but is zero.** Here it's a plain **`JOIN`** (not a `LEFT
   JOIN`): the item **must** be found in the `cost` list — i.e. it **has** a cost record — **and then**
   `WHERE c.unit_cost IS NULL OR c.unit_cost = 0` keeps only the ones whose cost is **blank or zero**.
   This is the exact opposite of COST-01: COST-01 fires when there's *no* record; COST-02 fires when
   there *is* one but it's worthless.

5. **`ranked` + final line — sample the backlog.** Because there's a large standing backlog, the daily
   run keeps only the **5 most recently active** (`WHERE rn <= 5`) so it tickets a representative
   sample rather than flooding the queue; `total_matches` still records how many there really were.

### Tables & columns used

**Tables:** Inventory Ledger (`consolidated_inventory_ledger`) **⋈** ERP standard cost
(`wonder-raw-prod.erp_prod_batch.inventitempriceftistaging`). **Join key:** `consumable_sku` ⇄ `ITEMID`.

| Column (table) | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `consumable_sku` (ledger) | An item active in inventory. | **Join key** to the ERP cost list. |
| `datetime_utc` (ledger) | When it last moved. | **Filter** — active yesterday; sorts the sample. |
| `ITEMID` (ERP) | The ERP's item id. | **Join key** — must exist (record present). |
| `unit_cost` (ERP, derived) | The item's standard cost (PRICE ÷ PRICEUNIT). | **The check** — flag when null or 0. |
| `item_name`, `facility_name` (ledger) | Item name, facility. | Triage context. |

### Example of a flagged record (from the dashboard)

A live exception currently open in the Workbench — **ERR-00044** (Jira **KAN-893**), routed to
Accounting:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `consumable_sku` / `item_name` | `4000981` / `Fresh Bean Sprouts (4 oz)` |
| Cost record in ERP? | **Yes**, but… |
| `standard_unit_cost` | `$0.00` ← **the problem** |
| `facility` (type) | `Reston` (HDR) |
| `last_seen` | `2026-06-28` |

**Why it's flagged:** the item is set up in the ERP, but its standard cost is $0 — so its waste,
on-hand value, and COGS all calculate to zero. Accounting needs to correct the standard cost in
Dynamics. (One of 600+ in the standing backlog; a daily sample is ticketed.)

### Plain-English walkthrough

This rule answers: *"this item was picked against Transfer Order #XYZ — but does Transfer Order
#XYZ actually exist?"* Transfer orders don't have their own table; they live in the PO table
(`int_ledger_purchase_orders`) alongside purchase orders, distinguished by `order_type='Transfer'`
(vs `'Purchase'`), with the transfer-order id in the same `po` column.

1. **`picks` — every Transfer Out yesterday, grouped by transfer-order id.** From the ledger,
   filter to `ref_order_type='Transfer Order'` and `l2_action='Transfer Out'` (the pick leg, not
   the receiving leg) with a non-null `ref_order_id`. **Excludes `system_of_origin =
   'digital_transfer_warehouse'`** — see the note below on why.

2. **`to_pop` — every transfer-order id that actually exists.** The set of `po` values in the PO
   table where `order_type='Transfer'`.

3. **`flagged` — `LEFT JOIN … WHERE t.to_id IS NULL`.** A pick whose transfer-order id has no
   match in `to_pop` is an orphan — items are moving against a transfer order that was never
   created (or never synced).

4. **`ranked` + final line — count, cap at 500, newest-first.**

**Why the Digital Transfer Warehouse exclusion matters.** `Digital Transfer Warehouse` is a
synthetic in-transit staging facility (`facility_id='FAC_DIGITAL_TRANSFER'`,
`facility_type='In-Transit'`), not a physical location. Its Transfer Out rows use freetext,
human-entered labels — `"Instacart"`, `"Sesame general"`, `"BRFC - August 12, 2026 (3)"`,
`"Mayonnaise (1 gal) - recount PO"` — for digital-channel and recount movements that are never
going to get a master transfer-order record, because there isn't a real transfer order behind
them. Checked live: every single one of these is an "orphan" by construction, and they made up
the large majority of daily hits before the exclusion. Real, numbered transfer orders (e.g.
`PO-390894`, `G-2625238` style ids) match the population reliably when they exist — this is a
targeted exclusion of one non-transfer facility, not a weakening of the underlying check.

### Tables & columns used

**Tables:** Inventory Ledger (`consolidated_inventory_ledger`) **⋈** PO Table
(`int_ledger_purchase_orders`, filtered to `order_type='Transfer'`).
**Join key:** `ref_order_id` (ledger) ⇄ `po` (PO table).

| Column (table) | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `ref_order_type` (ledger) | What kind of order this movement references. | **Filter** — `'Transfer Order'`. |
| `l2_action` (ledger) | The specific movement type. | **Filter** — `'Transfer Out'` (the pick leg). |
| `ref_order_id` (ledger) | The transfer-order id the pick was booked against. | **Join key** — must exist in the PO table's transfer population. |
| `system_of_origin` (ledger) | Which system produced the row. | **Exclusion filter** — drops `'digital_transfer_warehouse'` (ad hoc, no master TO record by design). |
| `po` (PO table) | The order id. | **Join key** — the transfer-order population. |
| `order_type` (PO table) | `'Purchase'` or `'Transfer'`. | **Filter** — scopes the population to real transfer orders. |

### Example of a flagged record (from live data)

Live BigQuery, 2026-08-07, Arcadia:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `to_id` (transfer order) | `DISH809` (no match in the transfer population ✗) |
| Items picked | 6 distinct SKUs, incl. `Cookies & Cream 8/14oz` |
| `facility` | `Arcadia` |
| `move` | Transfer Out |

**Why it's flagged:** items were picked and moved out against transfer order `DISH809`, but no
transfer order with that id exists in `int_ledger_purchase_orders`. Either the transfer order was
never created before the pick happened, or it never synced — SC Product (IMS) needs to reconcile
which.

Excludes Digital Transfer Warehouse and TOs that don't exist at all (that's XFER-01's job — this rule requires the TO to exist first). **Joined on `ims_sku`, not `consumable_sku`** — see below. Currently finds **0 in the last 30 days** on live data (243 all-time, spread thin across DISH/Arcadia/Millington) — a low-volume safety net, kept live to catch it the moment it recurs, same pattern as PO-13. |

### Why `ims_sku`, not `consumable_sku`

The obvious join key — `consumable_sku`, same as PO-14 uses for purchase orders — is a **trap**
here. Checked live on one sample day (2026-08-07, DISH): joining Transfer Out picks to TO lines on
`consumable_sku` produced **14,679 "orphans" out of 20,228 picks (72%)** where the transfer order
unambiguously existed. Spot-checking one: a pick against `PO-425282` for `consumable_sku='4000997'`
had no line for that sku on the TO — but the TO *did* have a line for `ims_sku='4200434'` at
`consumable_sku='4200434'`, and the ledger pick's own `ims_sku` was also `4200434`. The ledger's
`consumable_sku` is a per-system **translation** that doesn't line up 1:1 with the TO table's
`consumable_sku` for the same item; `ims_sku` is the raw id both tables share, and re-running the
exact same day's check keyed on `ims_sku` found **0** false positives. This is the identical lesson
already learned on PO-03 (see the "Refined per Jonny Li" note in that section) — it just hadn't
been applied to the transfer side yet.

### The SQL

### Plain-English walkthrough

This rule answers: *"this item was picked against Transfer Order #XYZ, and #XYZ is real — but did
#XYZ actually order this item?"*

1. **`picks` — every (transfer order, ims_sku) picked yesterday.** Same filter as XFER-01
   (`ref_order_type='Transfer Order'`, `l2_action='Transfer Out'`, excludes Digital Transfer
   Warehouse), but keyed on `ims_sku` instead of `ref_order_id` alone.

2. **`to_lines` — how much of each item each transfer order actually orders.** Summed
   `consumable_sku_qty` per `(po, ims_sku)` on the TO's lines.

3. **`to_exists`** — the set of real transfer-order ids, same population XFER-01 checks against.

4. **`flagged` — the match logic, identical shape to PO-14's:**
   - `JOIN to_exists … ON to_id = po` — require the TO to be **real** first. If it weren't, that's
     XFER-01's problem, not this rule's — this prevents the two rules from double-ticketing the
     same root cause.
   - `LEFT JOIN to_lines … WHERE COALESCE(ordered_qty, 0) <= 0` — the TO orders zero or none of
     this item (not on its lines at all, or on a line ordered for 0).

5. **`ranked` + final line** — count, cap at 500, newest-first.

### Tables & columns used

**Tables:** Inventory Ledger (`consolidated_inventory_ledger`) **⋈** PO Table
(`int_ledger_purchase_orders`, filtered to `order_type='Transfer'`).
**Join keys:** `ref_order_id` ⇄ `po` (the order) and **`ims_sku` ⇄ `ims_sku`** (the item — not
`consumable_sku`, see above).

| Column (table) | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `ref_order_id` (ledger) | The transfer order the pick was booked against. | **Join key** — must exist (`to_exists`). |
| `ims_sku` (ledger) | The raw system item id. | **Join key** — must have a positive-qty line on the TO. |
| `consumable_sku` (ledger) | The translated item id. | **Not used for joining** — shown on the ticket for context only. |
| `system_of_origin` (ledger) | Which system produced the row. | **Exclusion filter** — drops `'digital_transfer_warehouse'`. |
| `po`, `ims_sku` (PO table) | The TO's lines (what was ordered). | The "guest list" the picked item is matched against. |
| `consumable_sku_qty` (PO table) | Quantity ordered on the TO line. | **The check** — summed per (TO, `ims_sku`); `<= 0` (or no line) is a break. |

### Example of a flagged record (from live data)

Live BigQuery, 2026-05-23, Arcadia — Transfer Order `TO-DISH_DTC1333`:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `to_id` (transfer order) | `TO-DISH_DTC1333` (exists ✓) |
| `ims_sku` / `item_name` | `W34625` / `Marinara Sauce, 9 LB, Frozen` |
| On the TO's lines? | **No** ← **the problem** |
| `net_qty_change` | `-979,758.72` (base unit) |
| `system` | `Shiphero` |

**Why it's flagged:** the transfer order is valid, but this item was never ordered on it — the
same 3-way-match break PO-14 catches on the purchase side, just for transfers. This TO had **11**
items flagged this way the same day, all against the same TO id — worth a single reconciliation
pass rather than 11 separate tickets' worth of digging.

| **Live status** | 🟢 **Live — runs daily.** Added 2026-08-13. Covers both receiving legs tagged `ref_order_type='Transfer Order'`: `l2_action='Transfer In'` (DISH-type facilities) and `l2_action='Received'` (Pantry/HDR selling units). Excludes Digital Transfer Warehouse and TOs that don't exist (XFER-01's job). **Uses a different join predicate than XFER-02** — see below, this one is not a simple `ims_sku` equality. Live volume: **40–200/day** across ~180 HDR selling units plus DISH — a real, moderate-volume defect rate (not systemic noise). |

### Why this rule needed a different join than XFER-02 (the "-N" suffix)

XFER-02 (picking) joins cleanly on plain `ims_sku` equality. Naively reusing that same join for
receiving looked reasonable — but checked live, it produced a **15–70% false-positive rate at
literally every one of ~180 HDR selling units**, every day. Root cause: **827,000 of 22.48M**
transfer-order lines (concentrated in Pantry/HDR frozen "F" items) carry a **`-N` case-multiplier
suffix** on `ims_sku` — e.g. a TO line reads `ims_sku='4200584F-2'` for an item the ledger's
receiving leg reports as the bare `ims_sku='4200584F'`. Two candidate fixes were tested against
live data before picking one:

- **Strip the suffix on the TO side** (`GROUP BY REGEXP_REPLACE(ims_sku, r'-[0-9]+$', '')`) —
  fixed receiving completely (0 false positives), **but retested against XFER-02's picking-side
  query and broke it**: 67,755 new false orphans on the same 30-day window that was previously
  clean. Stripping merges genuinely distinct suffixed lines into one bucket, which is safe for
  receiving's aggregate-sum check but corrupts picking's.
- **Match exact-OR-suffixed per row** (`l.ims_sku = p.ims_sku OR l.ims_sku LIKE CONCAT(p.ims_sku,
  '-%')`), summing only the matching lines — fixed receiving (0 false positives, same result as
  stripping) **with zero effect on picking** (still 0/512,802 false positives on the same 30-day
  window, because it never merges unrelated lines together). This is the predicate XFER-05 uses.
  XFER-02 doesn't need it and wasn't changed.

### Plain-English walkthrough

1. **`picks`** — every (transfer order, `ims_sku`) received yesterday, either leg
   (`Transfer In` at DISH-type facilities, or `Received` at Pantry/HDR selling units), excluding
   Digital Transfer Warehouse.

2. **`to_exists`** — the same real-transfer-order population XFER-01/02 check against.

3. **`joined` + `agg`** — for each pick, `LEFT JOIN` the TO's lines using the **exact-or-suffixed**
   predicate, then re-aggregate (`SUM`/`ANY_VALUE`) back down to one row per (transfer order,
   `ims_sku`), since the join can match more than one line (e.g. a line at the bare id and another
   at a suffixed variant that both happen to apply — summing keeps the "total ordered" check
   correct rather than picking one arbitrarily).

4. **`flagged`** — `COALESCE(ordered_qty, 0) <= 0`: the TO orders zero or none of this item.

5. **`ranked` + final line** — count, cap at 500, newest-first.

### Tables & columns used

**Tables:** Inventory Ledger (`consolidated_inventory_ledger`) **⋈** PO Table
(`int_ledger_purchase_orders`, filtered to `order_type='Transfer'`).
**Join keys:** `ref_order_id` ⇄ `po` (the order) and **`ims_sku` ⇄ `ims_sku` (exact OR
`ims_sku` LIKE `ims_sku`+`'-%'`)** — not a plain equality, see above.

| Column (table) | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `l2_action` (ledger) | The specific movement type. | **Filter** — `'Transfer In'` or `'Received'` (the two receiving legs). |
| `ref_order_id` (ledger) | The transfer order the receipt was booked against. | **Join key** — must exist (`to_exists`). |
| `ims_sku` (ledger) | The raw system item id, unsuffixed on this leg. | **Join key** — matched against the TO's lines, suffix-tolerant. |
| `system_of_origin` (ledger) | Which system produced the row. | **Exclusion filter** — drops `'digital_transfer_warehouse'`. |
| `po`, `ims_sku` (PO table) | The TO's lines. `ims_sku` here may carry a `-N` case-multiplier suffix. | The "guest list" the received item is matched against. |
| `consumable_sku_qty` (PO table) | Quantity ordered on the TO line. | **The check** — summed across all matching (exact + suffixed) lines; `<= 0` is a break. |

### Example of a flagged record (from live data)

Live BigQuery, 2026-08-07, DISH:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `to_id` (transfer order) | `260806CK1-SHIP00029` (exists ✓) |
| `ims_sku` / `item_name` | `4200781-20` / `Steamed Jasmine Rice (270 g)` |
| On the TO's lines? | **No** ← **the problem** |
| `net_qty_change` | `+194,400` (base unit) |
| `system` | `Shiphero` |
| `movement` | Add / Transfer In |

**Why it's flagged:** the transfer order is valid, but this item — a large received quantity —
was never ordered on it. 76 items flagged this way across DISH and Pantry/HDR selling units the
same day, a moderate steady-state rate worth routing to SC Product (IMS) for reconciliation.

### Why "picked" can't be judged from the ledger alone here

Every other transfer rule (XFER-01/02/05) treats "a ledger row with `l2_action='Transfer Out'`
exists" as the sole truth for "picked." Reusing that here looked reasonable but checked live, it
false-positived at scale: of Transfer Orders with **zero** matching ledger rows, **~94% are
already `status=CLOSED` or `RECEIVED`** in the orders table — i.e. they obviously already shipped,
they just never got a row in `consolidated_inventory_ledger` under that transfer-order id. One
example, `PO-431527` (status `CLOSED`), has **zero rows in the ledger under any action, ever** —
not a join-key formatting issue like the `ims_sku` cases on XFER-02/05, a genuine gap in what
syncs into the ledger for a meaningful slice of transfers. Flagging on ledger absence alone would
have produced ~300+/day of pure noise.

**The fix:** a Transfer Order counts as already-picked if **either** a ledger Transfer Out row
exists **or** its own status has already advanced past picking (`SHIPPED`, `PARTIALLY_SHIPPED`,
`RECEIVED`, `PARTIALLY_RECEIVED`, `CLOSED`, `PICKED`, `PACKED`, `PACKING`, `PLACED`). Dead orders
(`CANCELLED`, `CANCELED`, `VOIDED`, `VENDOR_REJECTED`) are excluded from consideration entirely —
not a "no pick activity" case, just not a candidate either way. With that filter, the genuinely
still-early-lifecycle population (statuses like `PENDING`, `PLANNED`, `VENDOR_ACCEPTED`,
`NOT_RECEIVED`, `EXCEPTION`) with real zero pick activity is a believable ~10/day.

### Why the clock runs off the delivery date, not the order date

Raised in the 2026-09-14 data-analyst review of this SQL: *"some POs have multiple delivery dates,
need a where clause that filters these, or all later lines will show up once the first lines are
shipped."*

Two things were checked against live data:

- **Multiple delivery dates per order is real, but rare on transfers.** In a 60-day window, **23 of
  92,757** transfer orders carry more than one `expected_date` (max 2). It's far more common on
  **Purchase** POs — **612 of 5,654** (11%, up to 5 dates), which is why `PO-07`/`PO-08` already
  take `MAX(expected_date)` over their still-open lines. Example transfer: `VDC 5452`, wave 1 due
  2026-08-30 (cancelled), wave 2 due **2026-09-15** (`PENDING`, 896 units, nothing shipped).
- **The underlying defect — clocking from creation instead of delivery — was much bigger than the
  multi-date case.** Transfers are normally delivered the day after they're cut (`expected_date =
  order_date + 1` for 87,511 of 92,757), but a real tail is scheduled 5–14+ days out. On the
  order-date clock, **231 of 497** live candidates (46%) were flagged **before their delivery date
  had even passed** — every one of the 83 `VENDOR_ACCEPTED` orders and 131 of the 185 `PLANNED`
  ones, some scheduled six weeks out. Nothing *should* have been picked yet.

**The fix:** `due_date` = the **latest** `expected_date` across the lines still awaiting a pick, and
the rule ages off `COALESCE(due_date, order_date)`. Taking the latest such date is what answers the
analyst's point directly — once the first delivery wave ships, the later-dated wave governs the
clock and can't pull the order into the list before its own date arrives. Backlog went 497 → **266**;
the 231 that dropped out were all not-yet-due.

### Plain-English walkthrough

1. **`to_agg`** — every Transfer Order, one row per `po`, with its most recent creation date, the
   full set of distinct statuses seen across its lines, and `due_date`: the **latest**
   `expected_date` among the lines still awaiting a pick.
2. **`picked`** — the set of transfer-order ids with at least one real ledger Transfer Out row.
3. **`flagged`** — `LEFT JOIN … WHERE p.po IS NULL` (no ledger pick), **and** none of the order's
   statuses fall in the "already advanced or dead" list, **and** the delivery date has passed by
   the threshold (`COALESCE(due_date, order_date) < run_date - Y days` — so an order scheduled for
   next week isn't flagged today), **and** it's recent enough to matter (`order_date >= run_date -
   30 days`, so the rule stays on the current backlog rather than the full historical population).
4. **`ranked` + final line** — count, cap at 500, oldest-**due** first (the longest-overdue orders
   surface first, same convention as PO-07).

State-based, like PO-07/PO-08: this returns the **current** backlog each run, not just "new
today" — dedup on the app side prevents re-tickets, and the recheck auto-closes once a pick
appears or the status advances.

### Tables & columns used

**Tables:** PO Table (`int_ledger_purchase_orders`, `order_type='Transfer'`) **⋈** Inventory Ledger
(`consolidated_inventory_ledger`, activity check only).

| Column (table) | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `po` (PO table) | The transfer order id. | Grain of the check; join key against the ledger. |
| `expected_date` (PO table) | The line's scheduled delivery date. | **The clock** — `due_date`, the latest delivery date across the still-unpicked lines, is the aging baseline. |
| `po_date_utc` (PO table) | When the order was created. | Fallback clock when the TO carries no `expected_date`; also the 30-day recency window. |
| `status` (PO table) | The order's lifecycle status. | **The safety filter** — excludes dead and already-advanced orders (see write-up above), and picks which lines `due_date` is measured over. |
| `ref_order_type`, `l2_action`, `ref_order_id` (ledger) | Movement type and the order it references. | **The check** — `ref_order_type='Transfer Order'`, `l2_action='Transfer Out'`; absence = no pick. |

### Example of a flagged record (from live data)

Live BigQuery, run date 2026-09-14:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `transfer_order` | `PO-445621` |
| `facility` | Arcadia |
| `system` | POMS |
| `to_status` | `NOT_RECEIVED` |
| `order_date` | 2026-08-19 |
| `expected_date` | 2026-08-20 |
| `days_since_order` | 26 |
| `days_since_expected` | 25 |
| `breached_at` | 2026-08-22 |

**Why it's flagged:** due for delivery on 2026-08-20, still in an early (`NOT_RECEIVED`) status
25 days later, and no Transfer Out ledger row has ever been recorded against it — well past the
2-day threshold. The breach date is delivery date + 2.

**And one that is no longer flagged:** a `VENDOR_ACCEPTED` transfer order created 2026-09-05 and
scheduled for delivery 2026-10-29. On the old order-date clock it was flagged on 2026-09-08 for
"no pick activity"; nothing is supposed to be picked for another six weeks. 231 of the 497
candidates on 2026-09-14 were of this kind.

## XFER-07 · Transfer Picked — Not Received

> **In one sentence:** find real Transfer Orders that **were** picked but have had **zero
> receiving activity** more than **Z days** (default 2, **Admin-editable**) after the receipt was
> **due** — the later of the first pick and the scheduled delivery date of the unreceived lines.

### At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Rule number** | XFER-07 |
| **Rule type** | `AGING` |
| **Severity** | **Medium** — 2-day SLA |
| **Owner / routed team** | Field Ops |
| **Default assignee** | Priya Nair |
| **Jira** | Component **Transfers** |
| **Source tables** | Inventory Ledger (pick + receipt activity) **⋈** PO Table (existence + status check) |
| **Threshold** | **Z = 2 days**, editable in **Admin → Transfer order aging** (`PUT /api/xfer-aging`, `app_setting.xfer_not_received_days`). |
| **The clock** | `GREATEST(first_pick, due_date)` — the later of the first pick and the latest `expected_date` across the lines with nothing received. Falls back to `first_pick` alone when there's no `expected_date`. |
| **Live status** | 🟢 **Live — runs daily.** Added 2026-08-17 (backlog was 0 then); delivery-date gate added 2026-09-14 after data-analyst review. Current backlog: **58** (30-day lookback) — 61 on the pick-only clock, so the gate held back 3 not-yet-due orders. |

### Why the delivery date gates this one too

The same 2026-09-14 analyst note that re-anchored XFER-04 applies here: *"some POs have multiple
delivery dates, need a where clause that filters these, or all later lines will show up once the
first lines are shipped."* Two guards come out of it:

- **Picked early.** `first_pick` alone starts the receipt clock the moment anything is picked, even
  when delivery isn't scheduled for another week. Using `GREATEST(first_pick, due_date)` holds the
  clock until the receipt is genuinely due (3 of today's 61 candidates).
- **Multiple delivery dates.** `due_date` is measured over the lines with **nothing received**
  (`received_qty <= 0`) and takes the **latest** such date, so a later-dated delivery wave keeps
  the order out of the list until its own date passes rather than arriving already-overdue.

Rare on transfers today (23 of 92,757 orders carry more than one `expected_date`) — see the
[XFER-04 write-up](#why-the-clock-runs-off-the-delivery-date-not-the-order-date) for the full data
profile, including why this is much more common on Purchase POs.

### Why this one doesn't need the same status-based safety net as XFER-04

XFER-04's ledger-only definition broke because a real fraction of transfer orders complete their
whole lifecycle without ever touching the ledger. The receiving side doesn't have that problem:
checked live, **0 of 76,035** picked, non-cancelled transfer orders in a 90-day window lack a
matching `Transfer In` / `Received` ledger row. So XFER-07 stays ledger-only — pick date from the
ledger, receipt check from the ledger — with just a `status NOT IN ('CANCELLED','CANCELED',
'VOIDED')` filter (a cancelled-after-picking order is resolved, not stuck) and a requirement that
the transfer order actually exists (so this doesn't double-ticket XFER-01's job).

### The SQL

-- across the lines with nothing received, so an order picked ahead of schedule (or one with a
-- second later-dated delivery wave) isn't flagged before that date has passed.

### Plain-English walkthrough

1. **`picked`** — every transfer order with a real ledger Transfer Out row, and the date of its
   first one.
2. **`received`** — the set of transfer-order ids with at least one `Transfer In` / `Received`
   ledger row.
3. **`to_exists`** — requires the order to be real (skips XFER-01's territory) and carries status
   for the cancelled-order exclusion plus `due_date`, the latest delivery date across the lines
   with nothing received.
4. **`flagged`** — picked, not received, not cancelled, and overdue against
   `GREATEST(first_pick, due_date)` (so neither an early pick nor a later-dated delivery wave
   flags before its time) / recent enough (`first_pick >= run_date - 30 days`) to matter.
5. **`ranked` + final line** — count, cap at 500, oldest-**due** first.

State-based like XFER-04/PO-07/PO-08 — current backlog each run; recheck auto-closes once a
receiving-leg ledger row appears.

### Tables & columns used

**Tables:** Inventory Ledger (`consolidated_inventory_ledger`) **⋈** PO Table
(`int_ledger_purchase_orders`, `order_type='Transfer'`, existence + status only).

| Column (table) | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `ref_order_type`, `l2_action='Transfer Out'` (ledger) | The pick leg. | **One half of the clock start** — `first_pick`. |
| `expected_date`, `received_qty` (PO table) | Scheduled delivery date / what's arrived per line. | **The other half of the clock start** — `due_date` = latest `expected_date` among lines with `received_qty <= 0`; the clock starts at the later of the two. |
| `ref_order_id` (ledger) | The transfer order. | Join key against `to_exists` and `received`. |
| `l2_action IN ('Transfer In','Received')` (ledger) | The receiving leg. | **The check** — absence = not received. |
| `status` (PO table) | The order's lifecycle status. | **Exclusion filter** — drops cancelled/voided. |

### Example of a flagged record (from live data)

Live BigQuery, run date 2026-09-14:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `transfer_order` | `PO-464636` |
| `facility` | Martin Brower |
| `system` | Martin Brower |
| `first_pick` | 2026-08-31 |
| `expected_date` | 2026-09-01 |
| `days_since_pick` | 14 |
| `breached_at` | 2026-09-03 |

**Why it's flagged:** picked 2026-08-31, due at the destination 2026-09-01, and two weeks later
there is still no `Transfer In` / `Received` ledger row against it. The breach date is delivery
date + 2, not pick date + 2 — the clock starts at the later of the two.

The backlog was 0 when the rule went live on 2026-08-17 (see the 0/76,035 note above); the
Martin Brower cluster showing today is new, and worth raising with Field Ops on its own.

## TWH-01 · Transfer Warehouse In/Out Balance

> **DRAFTED — NOT LIVE.** This rule is documented and query-tested against live BigQuery data, but
> deliberately **not enabled** and **not wired into the daily finder**. It's here for a data
> engineer to confirm the flow assumptions below before it goes anywhere near real tickets.

> **In one sentence:** find an item that shows up on **one** of the two Digital Transfer
> Warehouse legs (arrived / left) but is **completely missing** from the other — the pattern in

> **only** at the two middle (digital) legs, not the starting or ending warehouse.

### At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Rule number** | TWH-01 (framework catalog — this is a separate family from XFER-0N, not one of the transfer-order rules built so far) |

| **Severity** | High (proposed — not yet confirmed) |
| **Owner / routed team** | Field Ops / Priya Nair (proposed, matches the other Transfers-component routing) |
| **Source table** | Inventory Ledger only (`consolidated_inventory_ledger`) — no PO/TO table join |
| **Status** | 🔵 **Drafted, not live.** `Rule.enabled = False` in both `reference.py` and the DB; not present in `bq_finder._FINDERS`. Cannot fire even if something else flips the DB flag, because there is no finder function wired to it. |
| **Current (draft) numbers** | 30-day window, existence mismatch only, aged 3+ days: **5,404** "arrived, never left" (~180/day), **6,313** "left, never arrived" (~210/day). See the two correction write-ups below for how much these numbers moved during investigation — read those before trusting any number here. |

### What this is comparing (and why it's narrower than it sounds)

The reference example (a real 4-row ledger excerpt a data engineer shared) shows one transfer as
four ledger rows: **origin** facility Transfer Out → **DTW** Transfer In → **DTW** Transfer Out →
**destination** facility Transfer In. This rule compares **only the middle two** — DTW's own
Transfer In vs. its own Transfer Out, for the same `(ref_order_id, item)` — and ignores what the
origin shipped and what the destination received. That's a deliberate scope decision: the other
two legs are a different, already-covered question (XFER-02 covers what was picked at the origin
not being on the TO; XFER-05 covers what was received at the destination not being on the TO).
This rule is specifically about whether the **warehouse's own bookkeeping** balances.

### Correction #1 — most "digital transfer warehouse" activity isn't part of this pattern at all

A naive version of this query (compare DTW In vs DTW Out for every item, no other filter) found
**3,616,977** "left DTW, never arrived" cases all-time — which turned out to be almost entirely
false alarms. Checked live: those items have **no non-DTW origin leg at all** for the same
`(ref_order_id, item)` — DTW isn't a staging waypoint for them, it's acting as its **own
originating warehouse** for a completely different flow (retail/Pantry-bound digital fulfillment).
**Fix:** require a real, non-DTW `Transfer Out` to exist for the same order + item before this
rule even looks at it — i.e. confirm "there's a starting warehouse" first. That dropped the
false-alarm population from 3.6M to **35,230** all-time (and further, once Correction #2 below is
applied, to a number consistent with the table above).

### Correction #2 — the same `ims_sku` suffix bug from XFER-05, recurring inside DTW itself

Even after Correction #1, the "arrived at DTW, never left" bucket was still enormous — **64,863**
in a 30-day/3-day-aged window, and it barely shrank with longer aging (still 20,413 at 21 days),
which doesn't behave like a real backlog. Investigated a sample of 200: **~85%** had a matching
`Transfer Out` at DTW under a **suffixed variant of the same `ims_sku`** (e.g. `Transfer In` posts
as `4200785-25`, `Transfer Out` posts as the bare `4200785`, or vice versa) — the identical
"-N case-multiplier suffix" issue already documented on XFER-05, just occurring on DTW's own two
legs instead of DTW-vs-TO-table. **Fix:** normalize both legs to a base sku
(`REGEXP_REPLACE(ims_sku, r'-[0-9]+$', '')`) before comparing. This is a safe within-order strip
here (unlike XFER-02's TO-table case) — checked and confirmed each `(ref_order_id, base_sku)` has
at most a small number of distinct suffixed variants, not the kind of fan-out that broke XFER-02's
attempt at the same fix — but this is exactly the kind of assumption a data engineer should
double-check before this goes live. Applying it dropped "arrived, never left" from 64,863 to
**5,404** in the same window — an 92% reduction, and a number that finally looks like a real,
believable backlog rather than a data-matching artifact.

### Open questions for the data engineer (this is why it's not live)

1. Is the suffix-normalization assumption in Correction #2 actually correct and exhaustive — are
   there other id-format quirks between DTW's two legs we haven't hit yet?
2. Is "requires a real non-DTW origin `Transfer Out` leg" (Correction #1) the right way to isolate
   genuine 4-leg staged transfers from the digital-fulfillment population, or is there a cleaner
   signal (a flag, a different `ref_order_type`, something else)?
3. Is a 3-day aging window the right cutoff before flagging "stuck" / "left without arriving"? (Not
   deeply calibrated yet — chosen because normal DTW transit time for *balanced* pairs is 0-2 days
   in the vast majority of cases.)
4. **Phase 2, not designed yet:** what to do about the **79,944** pairs (same 30-day window) where
   *both* legs are present but the quantities don't match — a magnitude/percentage question,
   deliberately deferred until Phase 1 (existence-only) is confirmed correct.

### The SQL (documented in `reference.py`, not wired to a live finder)

```sql
-- Catalog rule (framework TWH-01) — DRAFTED, NOT LIVE, pending data-engineer confirmation.
-- Compares ONLY the two ledger legs recorded AT the Digital Transfer Warehouse itself
-- (Transfer In = arrived; Transfer Out = left) for the same (ref_order_id, item) — deliberately
-- ignoring the origin and destination facilities' own legs. Requires a real non-DTW origin
-- 'Transfer Out' leg to exist first (excludes the ~3.6M pure digital-fulfillment DTW-as-source
-- population that never has a matching origin leg and isn't part of this pattern at all).
-- ims_sku is compared suffix-normalized (strip a trailing '-N') — the exact-vs-suffixed id
-- mismatch already found on XFER-05 recurs here between the DTW In and Out legs themselves.
-- Phase 1 (this query): existence-only — flags an item present on one DTW leg but completely
-- absent from the other. Phase 2 (not designed yet): both legs present but quantities differ
-- by more than X% — deferred pending Phase 1 sign-off.

### Tables & columns used

**Table:** Inventory Ledger (`consolidated_inventory_ledger`) only — no PO/TO table join.

| Column | Plain meaning | Role in this rule |
|---|---|---|
| `system_of_origin` | Which system produced the row. | **Scope filter** — `'digital_transfer_warehouse'` for the two legs being compared; `!=` that for confirming a real origin leg exists. |
| `ref_order_type`, `ref_order_id` | Transfer-order tag and id. | Filter + join key. |
| `l2_action` | `'Transfer In'` (arrived) vs `'Transfer Out'` (left). | **The two legs being compared.** |
| `ims_sku` | Raw item id — sometimes suffixed with `-N`. | **Join key, suffix-normalized** — see Correction #2. |
| `consumable_quantity_change` | Signed quantity. | Summed per leg to get `dtw_in` / `dtw_out`. |
| `datetime_utc` | When the movement happened. | **Aging** — `last_activity` vs. the 3-day floor. |

### Example (drafted, from live data)

**Arrived at DTW, never left** — `PO-410376`, Veggie Burger Patty FZN (5 ea): 5 units arrived at
DTW from DISH on 2026-07-28, no matching `Transfer Out` since. `PO-429986`, Lime Juice (32 fl oz):
907 units arrived from DISH on 2026-08-10, still sitting.

**Left DTW, never arrived** — `PO-416356`, Diet Dr. Pepper (12 can): 36 units left DTW on
2026-08-03 (originated at Shawnee) with no matching `Transfer In` ever recorded. `PO-422761`,
Jarritos Lime Soda (24 ea): same pattern, originated at Shawnee, left DTW 2026-08-06.

creates tickets · 🟡 **Catalog-only** = enabled but no detection query is wired yet, so it silently
finds nothing · ⚪ **Paused** = query exists but the rule is toggled off · 🔵 **Drafted, not live** =
query written and validated against live data, documented here in full, but deliberately not
enabled and not wired into any finder — waiting on a specific person's confirmation before going
further.

The PO family, **XFER-01**, **XFER-02**, **XFER-04**, **XFER-05**, **XFER-07**, **TWH-01**
(drafted, not live), and both cost rules are fully documented above. Still **to do** (live,
not yet written up): the two daily facility-dollar rules — **WASTE-DAILY** and **ADJ-DAILY**. The
**catalog-only** rules (PO-02, COMPLETE-02) will be written up when their detectors are wired.
