"""BigQuery rule finders — push the rule logic into SQL and return ONLY offending rows.

At 187M-row ledger / 18.8M-row PO scale we can't fetch tables into Python, so the
bigquery data path uses these SQL finders instead of the in-Python engine. Every query
is capped via maximum_bytes_billed so a misfire can never run up a large bill.

Currently implemented: PO-03 over-receipt and PO-01 null-PO-on-receipt both fire on real
data (PO-01 catches Fishbowl/CK1 blank-PO receipts). PO-02 is kept in the catalog but finds
nothing on current data. XFER-01 (transfer order missing) also fires on real data, scoped to
exclude the synthetic Digital Transfer Warehouse facility (see _build_transfer_order_missing_sql).
XFER-02 (SKU not on the transfer order) is joined on ims_sku, not consumable_sku — see
_build_sku_not_on_to_sql for why that matters. XFER-05 (received SKU not on the transfer order)
needs a different join still (exact-or-suffixed ims_sku) — see _build_received_sku_not_on_to_sql.

#            consumable_quantity_change is 100% populated, ledger.ims_quantity_change is ALSO stored
