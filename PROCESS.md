# PROCESS — Wonder Inventory Data-Quality Platform

A living log of the project. **Updated at every step** with what was completed (dated) and what's next. Newest entries on top.

> Process rule (from stakeholder walkthrough): visual mockups are built and socialized for approval **before** any production code. Touchpoint meetings every other day. End every phase by updating this file.

---

## What's next

- **Provide the live connection details so the running app can flip from fixtures to real data:**
  - **BigQuery (read-only):** GCP project, dataset, the unified-ledger + PO table names, and a service-account key path (or `gcloud auth application-default login`). Plus the real **column names** so `app/backend/wonder/schema_map.py` can be aligned.
  - **Jira Cloud sandbox:** base URL, email + API token, project key, issue type, and (optional) the fingerprint custom-field id.
  These drop into `app/backend/.env` (template at `app/.env.example`); no code changes needed.
- **Confirm the seeded rule thresholds** (over-receipt %, which rules are Hard vs Soft) and grow the rule set beyond the seeded five.
- **Walk Pavel through the running app + approved console** at the Thursday touchpoint; gather polish notes; confirm the **sub-assignment / ownership-transfer** rules (implemented as designed — primary stays accountable, SLA does not reset, transitions audited — but pending sign-off).
- **Then harden toward production:** push the repo, Terraform + Cloud SQL Postgres (swap `APP_DB_URL`), BigQuery SQL pushdown for large partitions, the Jira webhook + polling reconciliation, Entra SSO + role-based views, and a write-through Admin screen.

## Completed to date

### 2026-09-14 — Azure hosting switched to App Service; daily-run performance profiled

- **Client request: App Service instead of Container Apps.** Their platform team standardizes on App
  Service, so `infra/terraform-azure/` was converted. `terraform validate`-clean against `azurerm`
  4.81; still not applied (needs the subscription from GO-LIVE-AZURE §0).
  - `azurerm_container_app` + `azurerm_container_app_environment` → **`azurerm_linux_web_app` +
    `azurerm_service_plan`** (Linux, Web App for Containers).
  - Container Apps `secret {}` blocks → **App Service Key Vault references**
    (`@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=...)` app settings), still by *versionless* URI so rotation needs
    no Terraform change. Required naming the user-assigned identity in
    `key_vault_reference_identity_id` — without it App Service resolves references with the
    non-existent *system*-assigned identity and every secret app setting silently comes back empty.
  - `ingress { target_port = 8000 }` → `WEBSITES_PORT`; ingress `ip_security_restriction` →
    `site_config.ip_restriction` + an explicit `ip_restriction_default_action` (only flipped to
    `Deny` when the allowlist is non-empty, so a misconfig can't lock everyone out) +
    `scm_use_main_ip_restriction` so Kudu follows the same list.
  - `min_replicas`/`max_replicas`/`container_cpu`/`container_memory` → `app_service_sku` (default
    `B1`, validated to reject Free/Shared) + `app_service_worker_count` + `always_on`. **No
    scale-to-zero on App Service** — the plan is always allocated, which removes the cold-start
    `alembic upgrade head` but also the idle savings. `container_app_environment_id` is gone.
  - Added `health_check_path = /api/health` (the dependency-free 200 — deliberately *not*
    `/api/runinfo`, which hits the DB and would eject the app on a Postgres blip), a diagnostic
    setting to Log Analytics for container stdout / HTTP / platform logs (App Service doesn't require
    a workspace the way Container Apps did, and without one the logs are ephemeral), and an
    `app_outbound_ips` output. Web app names are now suffixed because App Service hostnames are
    *globally* unique. `var.image` stays one fully-qualified string and is split into
    registry + `repo:tag` in `locals` (verified against three image shapes; a registry-less value is
    rejected by a variable validation rather than silently producing `https://nginx:latest`).
- **⛔ The switch surfaced a deploy blocker (GO-LIVE-AZURE §7.5).** App Service's front end drops any
  request that sends no response bytes for **~230s and that is not configurable** (Container Apps'
  ingress timeout was). `POST /api/run` blocks for **~15 min**, so a *successful* run still returns
  502. Worked around for the nightly trigger only: the timer function now POSTs, treats a gateway
  timeout as "run started", polls `GET /api/runinfo` until the run date advances, and **never raises
  on timeout** — a raised invocation can be retried by the host and a retry would start a second
  concurrent run (duplicate Jira churn is worse than an unconfirmed run). Confirmation is best-effort:
  Consumption caps `functionTimeout` at 10 min, under the 15 min run. The **Logic App trigger option
  is unusable** until this is fixed (its HTTP action's sync limit is ~120s, and `azurerm` exposes
  neither the timeout nor the async-pattern option). The **console button is not worked around** and
  will error after ~4 min. Real fix: make `/api/run` return a run id immediately and poll
  `/api/runinfo`.
- **Profiled the 15-minute run** (user asked whether it grows unboundedly — it does not).
  - **~90% is serial Jira HTTP.** The 2026-09-13 run (403 findings / 307 new / 175 auto-closed) makes
    ~307 create POSTs + ~96 recurrence comments + 175×3 for auto-close (`close()` = comment + `GET
    /transitions` + POST transition) ≈ **930 sequential round-trips** on one un-pooled `httpx.Client`.
    BigQuery is the minority cost: 18 finders + 18 rechecks fired one at a time, ~2–5s job latency each.
  - **Not unbounded.** Finders are windowed (`RECEIPT_LOOKBACK_DAYS=30`, XFER 30d) and capped at
    `RESULT_CAP=500`/rule, so detection is flat regardless of elapsed days. What looked like growth
    was backlog absorption (new/run: 148 → 285 → 314 → 389 → 307). The one term that *does* grow is
    the open backlog (1,261 open) — the 18 recheck queries pass the whole open set as `IN UNNEST`
    array params; `retention.purge_closed` bounds closed tickets only.
  - Also noted: there is **no run timing instrumentation at all** — `ValidationRun.started_at` and
    `finished_at` are both `_ts(run_date)`, a deterministic string.
  - **Deferred optimization list** (agreed: note now, implement later): parallelize the Jira calls
    with a bounded pool + 429 retry (~10×, 15 min → ~90s); cache the per-issue `GET /transitions`
    that `close()` repeats for an identical answer (~a third of auto-close cost, nearly free); stop
    commenting "still reproducing" on every open ticket every run (30 days open = 30 identical
    comments — noisy *and* slow); fire the 18 finders + 18 rechecks concurrently; scope rechecks to
    touched entities instead of the whole open set (fixes the growth term).

### 2026-09-14 — XFER-04 / XFER-07 re-anchored to the delivery date (data-analyst review)

- The data analyst reviewed the transfer SQL and flagged both aging rules: *"some POs have multiple
  delivery dates, need a where clause that filters these, or all later lines will show up once the
  first lines are shipped."* Checked both halves of that against live BigQuery before changing
  anything:
  - **Multiple delivery dates per order is real but rare on transfers** — **23 of 92,757** TOs in a
    60-day window carry more than one `expected_date` (max 2; e.g. `VDC 5452`, wave 1 due 08-30
    cancelled, wave 2 due 09-15 still `PENDING` with 896 units unshipped). It's much more common on
    **Purchase** POs — **612 of 5,654** (11%, up to 5 dates), which is why `PO-07`/`PO-08` already
    take `MAX(expected_date)` over their open lines.
  - **The bigger defect the note exposed: both rules clocked off the wrong date.** XFER-04 aged from
    `po_date_utc` (creation). Transfers normally deliver the next day (87,511 of 92,757 at
    `order_date + 1`), but a real tail is scheduled 5–14+ days out — so **231 of 497** live
    candidates (46%) were being flagged **before their delivery date had passed**: all 83
    `VENDOR_ACCEPTED` and 131 of 185 `PLANNED`, some scheduled six weeks out.
- **Fix (both rules now age off the delivery date, taking the LATEST relevant one — which is
  exactly what stops a later-dated wave from surfacing once the first wave ships):**
  - **XFER-04** — `due_date` = `MAX(expected_date)` across the lines still awaiting a pick; ages off
    `COALESCE(due_date, order_date)` (order date only when the TO has no `expected_date`), breach
    date and ordering follow the same anchor. Live: **497 → 266**.
  - **XFER-07** — `due_date` = `MAX(expected_date)` across the lines with nothing received
    (`received_qty <= 0`); the clock starts at `GREATEST(first_pick, due_date)`, so neither an
    early pick nor a later-dated wave flags before its time. Live: **61 → 58**.
  - Snapshots now carry `expected_date` (+ `days_since_expected` on XFER-04) so the ticket shows
    which date the clock ran from; `breached_at` is delivery date + threshold, which is what the
    age/severity math uses.
- Both new queries executed against live BigQuery (266 / 58 rows, matching the projections) and both
  catalog SQL blocks dry-run clean. Updated in `bq_finder.py`, `reference.py` (catalog SQL +
  plain-language descriptions) and `docs/rule-sql-guide.md` (new "why the clock runs off the delivery
  date" write-ups, refreshed SQL, walkthroughs, column tables and live examples for both rules).
- **Open for the analyst / Field Ops:** (1) XFER-07 now shows a **58-order Martin Brower cluster**
  picked but never received (backlog was 0 when the rule went live on 08-17) — new, and worth a look
  on its own. (2) Both rules are still **PO-grain**: any line advanced past picking suppresses the
  whole TO (XFER-04), and any receiving row suppresses it (XFER-07). That means a stuck *later* wave
  on a multi-date order is currently **under**-reported rather than over-reported. Fixing that means
  re-graining the rules (and their ticket entity keys) to (TO × delivery date) — deferred as it only
  affects 23 of 92,757 orders and would churn dedup/auto-close; raise with the analyst to confirm
  that's the right trade.

### 2026-09-10 — Client-facing process documentation for Confluence

- Wrote [`docs/PROCESS-OVERVIEW.md`](docs/PROCESS-OVERVIEW.md) (+ `.docx`) — a **plain-language, one-page process overview** for the client's Confluence space, aimed at business readers (Accounting / Supply Chain / Field Ops) with a short hosting section for the platform team.
- Covers: why the system exists, the nightly detect → de-dup → route → ticket → remediate → auto-close → measure cycle (with an ASCII flow), Hard vs Soft fails, the Urgent/High/Medium/Low SLA model and the **data-derived clock start**, primary-owner vs current-holder accountability, the five console screens, Jira behaviour (no duplicates, two-way sync, per-ticket auto-close), what the business can change in Admin without a developer, coverage by area, and roles & responsibilities.
- **Azure is the stated hosting path** throughout (Container Apps · PostgreSQL Flexible Server · Key Vault · ACR · Functions timer · Log Analytics · Terraform), with BigQuery explicitly staying in GCP as read-only source. *(Hosting moved to **App Service** on 2026-09-14 at the client's request — see that entry.)* Entra ID SSO described as the sign-in model (platform-level, no app code).
- **Appendix A** lists all **18 live rules** with severity, Hard/Soft, and owning team; **Appendix B** is a glossary. Per the user's call, the page describes the **steady state only** — pending decisions (Entra confirmation, cutover date, threshold tuning, key rotation) stay in [`docs/GO-LIVE-AZURE.md`](docs/GO-LIVE-AZURE.md) and are not surfaced to the client page.
- `.docx` generated with an arm64 pandoc (the vendored `pandoc-3.10.2-x86_64-macOS.pkg` in `app/backend/` is x86-only and won't run on this machine — no Rosetta).

### 2026-08-17 — TWH-01 drafted (Transfer Warehouse in/out balance) — DOCUMENTED, deliberately NOT live
- User shared a real 4-row ledger excerpt (origin Transfer Out → DTW Transfer In → DTW Transfer
  Out → destination Transfer In) as the pattern to replicate — this is the long-catalogued
  **TWH-01** rule (separate family from XFER-0N), previously just a WIP stub. Scoped per explicit
  direction: compare **only** the two legs recorded at the Digital Transfer Warehouse itself
  (In vs Out), ignoring the origin and destination legs entirely — those are already covered by
  XFER-02/XFER-05 and are out of scope here.
- **Two corrections found before the numbers were trustworthy, both surfaced and confirmed with
  the user before proceeding:**
  1. A naive DTW-In-vs-Out comparison found 3.6M "left DTW, never arrived" cases — almost all
     false alarms from a completely different flow (DTW acting as its own source for
     retail/Pantry digital fulfillment, not a staging waypoint). Fix: require a real non-DTW
     origin `Transfer Out` leg to exist first. Dropped to 35,230 all-time.
  2. Even after that, "arrived at DTW, never left" stayed enormous (64,863/30d, barely dropping
     with longer aging) — the user pushed back that this didn't sound plausible, which was the
     right call: ~85% of a sample had a matching Out leg under a **suffixed variant of the same
     `ims_sku`** — the identical XFER-05 case-multiplier-suffix bug, recurring on DTW's own two
     legs. Fix: suffix-normalize before comparing. Dropped to 5,404/30d (~180/day) — a 92%
     reduction, finally a believable number.
- **Explicitly NOT put live**, per direct instruction: documented in full in
  `docs/rule-sql-guide.md` (including both correction write-ups, open questions for the data
  engineer, and real examples) and in `reference.py`'s `TWH-01` catalog entry (`enabled: False`,
  and — unlike every other rule this session — deliberately **not** added to
  `bq_finder._FINDERS`, so there's no live finder function for it at all; flipping the DB flag
  alone can't make it fire). Holding for data-engineer sign-off on: the suffix-normalization
  assumption, the origin-leg-required scoping, the 3-day aging cutoff, and Phase 2 (quantity
  magnitude mismatch when both legs are present — 79,944/30d, not designed yet).

### 2026-08-17 — XFER-04 & XFER-07: transfer-order aging (no pick activity / picked-but-not-received), first admin-editable rule thresholds
- Fourth and fifth transfer rules, requested together since the user wasn't sure what "picked"
  should mean for the no-pick-activity case and asked to use the picked-but-not-received rule's
  clearer semantics to inform it. Both are `AGING` rules (Field Ops / Priya Nair / component
  "Transfers"), and both ship with a day-threshold that's **admin-editable** (a new capability —
  first rule params exposed as their own write-through Admin control, `Admin → Transfer order
  aging`, backed by `app_setting` the same way closed-ticket retention already is) rather than a
  `.env`/code constant like PO-07/PO-08's day thresholds.
- **XFER-07 (picked but not received, Z days, default 2)** was straightforward: pick date + receipt
  check both from the ledger, require the TO to exist (skip XFER-01's territory), exclude
  cancelled/voided. Verified live: 0 of 76,035 picked, non-cancelled transfer orders in a 90-day
  window lack a matching receiving-leg row — ledger-only is fully reliable here. Current backlog: 0
  (a clean safety net, same shape as PO-13).
- **XFER-04 (no pick activity, Y days, default 2)** needed a real design decision, surfaced to the
  user before building: checking the ledger alone (same approach as every other transfer rule)
  false-positived at scale — of Transfer Orders with **zero** matching `Transfer Out` ledger rows,
  **~94% are already `status=CLOSED` or `RECEIVED`** in the orders table. One example, `PO-431527`
  (status `CLOSED`), has zero rows in the ledger under any action, ever — a genuine gap in what
  syncs into `consolidated_inventory_ledger` for a meaningful slice of transfers, not a fixable
  join-key issue like the `ims_sku` cases on XFER-02/05. User confirmed (after an initial
  false-start answer that got corrected): treat a TO as already-picked if EITHER a ledger pick row
  exists OR its own status has advanced past picking (`SHIPPED`/`PARTIALLY_SHIPPED`/`RECEIVED`/
  `PARTIALLY_RECEIVED`/`CLOSED`/`PICKED`/`PACKED`/`PACKING`/`PLACED`); dead orders (`CANCELLED`/
  `CANCELED`/`VOIDED`/`VENDOR_REJECTED`) excluded entirely. With that filter, current backlog is
  150 over a 30-day window (~10/day) — real, plausible, still-early-lifecycle orders sitting idle.
- Wired end-to-end: `reference.py` (rules/error-types/labels/routing + the new
  `set_xfer_day_thresholds`/`xfer_no_pick_days`/`xfer_not_received_days` live-value pattern,
  mirroring the facility $ bands), new `wonder/xfer_aging.py` module (app_setting get/set, mirrors
  `retention.py`), `thresholds.refresh(db)` now also loads these two into `reference`'s live state,
  `bq_finder.py` finders + rechecks, `validate.py` auto-close dispatch, `PUT /api/xfer-aging`
  endpoint + audit log, `bootstrap` settings blob (`xferNoPickDays`/`xferNotReceivedDays`), and a
  new `TransferAgingEditor` card in the React Admin page (same pattern as the retention-days
  editor). Verified the admin edit actually changes live finder output (Y=2 → 150 backlog, Y=10 →
  98) before calling it done.

### 2026-08-13 — XFER-05: received item not listed on its Transfer Order (a second, different join-key trap)
- Third transfer rule. Receiving-side sibling of XFER-02: covers both receiving legs tagged
  `ref_order_type='Transfer Order'` — `l2_action='Transfer In'` (DISH-type facilities) and
  `l2_action='Received'` (Pantry/HDR selling units, ~180 of them). Note on numbering: the user
  asked for this one right after XFER-02 and initially suggested calling it XFER-03, but the
  framework catalog (`docs/validation-tests.csv`) already assigns XFER-03 to a quantity-mismatch
  rule and XFER-05 to this one — built it as **XFER-05** to keep code ids matching the catalog.
- **Found a second, different join-key trap, not fixable by reusing XFER-02's fix.** Naively
  reusing XFER-02's plain `ims_sku` equality for receiving looked reasonable but false-positived
  **15–70% of every single HDR selling unit** on live data (~180 stores, every day). Root cause:
  **827,000 of 22.48M** transfer-order lines — concentrated in Pantry/HDR frozen "F" items — carry
  a `-N` case-multiplier suffix on `ims_sku` (e.g. TO line `ims_sku='4200584F-2'` for a ledger
  receiving row reporting the bare `ims_sku='4200584F'`).
- Tested two fixes against live data before picking one: **stripping the suffix** on the TO side
  fixed receiving (0 false positives) but, re-tested against XFER-02's already-shipped picking
  query, **introduced 67,755 new false orphans** on the same 30-day window that was previously
  clean — merging suffixed variants into one bucket is safe for receiving's sum-check but corrupts
  picking's. **Matching exact-OR-suffixed per row** (`ims_sku = p.ims_sku OR ims_sku LIKE
  p.ims_sku||'-%'`, summing only matching lines) fixed receiving with the same 0-false-positive
  result and **zero effect on picking** (still 0/512,802 on the same window) — this is the
  predicate shipped. XFER-02 itself was left untouched; it doesn't need this and already validated
  clean.
- Live volume: 40–200/day across DISH + all HDR selling units combined — a real, moderate-volume
  defect rate (not systemic noise, unlike the Digital Transfer Warehouse issue on XFER-01).
- Wired end-to-end: `reference.py` (rule/error-type/label/routing — **SC Product (IMS) / Marcus
  Webb / component "3-Way Match"**, matching PO-14's routing since this is the transfer-side
  3-way match on the receiving leg), `bq_finder.py` finder + recheck, `validate.py` auto-close
  dispatch, `docs/rule-sql-guide.md`.

### 2026-08-13 — XFER-02: picked item not listed on its Transfer Order (found the PO-03 lesson recurring)
- Second transfer rule, same two tables as XFER-01. Requires the Transfer Order to **exist**
  (otherwise it's XFER-01's job) and checks whether the TO's lines actually order the picked item —
  the transfer-side sibling of PO-14's 3-way match.
- **Found the same join-key trap PO-03 hit, on a different rule.** The obvious key — `consumable_sku`,
  same as PO-14 uses for purchase orders — produced a **72% false-positive rate** on a live sample
  day (14,679 of 20,228 DISH picks against real, existing transfer orders came back "not on the
  TO"). Root cause: `consumable_sku` on the ledger is a per-system **translation** that doesn't line
  up 1:1 with the TO table's `consumable_sku` for the same item. Re-keyed the join on **`ims_sku`**
  (the raw id both tables share) — 0 false positives on the same sample day. Exact same fix already
  applied to PO-03 (see the "Refined per Jonny Li" note in that rule's history); PO-14 was built on
  `consumable_sku` and hasn't been re-checked for the same issue (not touched — existing rule, out
  of scope here).
- Also excludes Digital Transfer Warehouse, same as XFER-01.
- Live volume: 0 in the last 30 days, 243 all-time across DISH/Arcadia/Millington — low-volume
  safety net (same shape as PO-13), kept enabled rather than held back, since it's cheap to run and
  catches real 3-way-match breaks (verified example: TO `TO-DISH_DTC1333` at Arcadia, 11 items
  picked that weren't on the TO's lines, incl. `Marinara Sauce, 9 LB, Frozen`).
- Wired end-to-end: `reference.py` (rule/error-type/label/routing — Field Ops / Priya Nair /
  component "Transfers"), `bq_finder.py` finder + recheck (auto-closes once the item is added to the
  TO's lines with qty > 0), `validate.py` auto-close dispatch, `docs/rule-sql-guide.md`.

### 2026-08-13 — XFER-01 re-enabled: transfer order missing, scoped to exclude Digital Transfer Warehouse noise
- Revisited **XFER-01** (disabled 2026-06-11 per Pavel: "transfer orders out of scope for now") to add the first transfer-family exception. Verified the join logic directly against live BigQuery before flipping it on, since the DB row (`Rule.enabled`) isn't touched by `sync_catalog`'s insert-missing-only sync — required a direct update alongside the `reference.py` change.
- **Root cause of "out of scope" found:** on the actual daily production cadence (single run-date, not an all-time scan), the un-scoped rule fires **5–30 tickets every day**, almost entirely from the synthetic **Digital Transfer Warehouse** facility (`facility_id='FAC_DIGITAL_TRANSFER'`, `facility_type='In-Transit'`, `system_of_origin='digital_transfer_warehouse'`). That facility's `Transfer Out` rows use freetext ad hoc labels (`"Instacart"`, `"Sesame general"`, `"BRFC - <date>"`, `"... - recount PO"`) for digital-channel/recount movements that never get a master transfer-order record — every one of them is a false positive by construction, not a real defect. Pavel's pause was correct given the rule as originally written.
- **Fix:** added `AND system_of_origin != 'digital_transfer_warehouse'` to both the catalog SQL and the live finder (`_build_transfer_order_missing_sql` in `bq_finder.py`). Real numbered transfer orders (`PO-######`, `G-#######` style ids) match the transfer population reliably when they exist — confirmed 0 false positives among those patterns. Post-exclusion daily volume: **0–19/day**, mostly at Arcadia, referencing real transferred food items (verified a live example: `DISH809` at Arcadia, 6 SKUs incl. Cookies & Cream, no matching transfer order) — genuine, actionable orphan-pick defects for SC Product (IMS).
- Flipped `enabled: True` in `reference.py` + the live DB row; removed the "(WIP)" tag from `ERROR_TYPE_LABELS`; documented in `docs/rule-sql-guide.md` (new XFER-01 section + coverage tracker) and here.
- **Next transfer rules to build:** XFER-02 through XFER-07 are cataloged in `docs/validation-tests.md`/`.csv` (class "5. Inter-network Transfers In & Out") but not yet wired — quantity mismatches, no-pick/no-receipt aging, and received-but-not-on-TO checks.

### 2026-06-12 — Cost-data rules: waste SKU without cost + zero-cost consumable (#66)
- Two new **Accounting (Cost Accountant)** rules off the now-wired ERP standard cost, both with an explicit per-finding **`why_flagged`** explanation surfaced as a callout at the top of the drawer (and carried into the Jira body):
  - **`WASTE_SKU_NO_COST` (COST-01, High)** — a waste-active `consumable_sku` with **no** ERP cost record (no `ITEMID` match), so its waste can't be valued. Small population → **all** ticketed (5).
  - **`CONSUMABLE_ZERO_COST` (COST-02, High, framework #66)** — a ledger-active `consumable_sku` that **has** a cost record but the standard cost is **$0/NULL**. 600+ in the full cost-table backlog, but only ~4–5 are ledger-active in the rolling window; **capped to 5** for the Jira test (`ZERO_COST_TEST_CAP`).
- Both auto-close when the cost is set up / corrected in Dynamics. Drawer change: `why_flagged` + `uom_mismatch_note` render as a "Why this is flagged" callout (hidden from the raw snapshot grid).
- **Readable error-type labels.** Added `reference.ERROR_TYPE_LABELS` (+ `error_label()`) — a display-name layer (e.g. `PO_OVER_RECEIPT` → "PO Over Receipt", `WASTE_DAILY_FACILITY` → "Daily Waste (Facility)"). The codes stay the stable internal keys (DB/routing/fingerprints/filters); labels drive the **console** (table, drawer, filter dropdown, charts, leaderboard, routing tab — via `errLabel()`) and **Jira ticket titles**. Bootstrap injects `label` onto each `errorTypes` entry.

### 2026-06-11 — Over-receipt re-tier + facility routing; waste refactor; cleanups
- **Jira priority fix:** Jira's scheme was renamed to Urgent/High/Medium/Low (no "Highest"), so the old `Urgent→Highest` map was rejected and tickets silently fell back to Medium. Mapped identity; app Urgents now post as Jira **Urgent** (backfilled the existing tickets).
- **Over-receipt re-tiered (per Pavel):** flag floor **5%→30%**; **30–99% over → High** (supply-chain signal), **≥100% over (received ≥2× ordered) → Urgent** (likely receiving error). The old >2× `PO_IMPLAUSIBLE_QTY` tier **folds into** the Urgent band (kept in the catalog as deprecated for historical tickets, no longer emitted).
- **Facility-type routing:** profiled the ledger's `facility_type` → **HDR** (131 selling units), **DISH** (7), **CK** (1), **PRODUCTION** (2). `PO_OVER_RECEIPT` and the new daily-waste exception now route by bucket: **HDR → Field Ops — IKC**; **CK/DISH/PRODUCTION (and unknown) → Field Ops — ProdCo** (two new teams + Jira group labels `dq-field-ops-ikc` / `-prodco`).
- **Waste refactor:** collapsed to a single exception per Pavel — **`WASTE_DAILY_FACILITY`** (dropped `WASTE_IMPLAUSIBLE_QTY`: the facility-day flag is enough, it's then on someone to investigate). A facility's **net** daily waste $ over its **facility-type threshold** (placeholder $ pending the standard-cost table), banded **High/Urgent**, drawer lists top loss SKUs (sorted; no over-engineering). **Net** = all `l1='Adjust'` activity *except* transfers (Move From/To) and receiving/admin corrections, signed — so losses (Lost/Expiration/Damage/Recall/cycle-count shrink) net against **Found** / cycle-count recoveries of the same item (profiled the real `l2_action` catalog to get this right), valued at standard cost. Dashboard `waste_by_location` uses the same net + per-type thresholds.
- **Standard cost wired in (Dynamics ERP):** swapped the PO-derived cost placeholder for Pavel's real standard-cost query (`wonder-raw-prod.erp_prod_batch`, latest-activated `PRICE/PRICEUNIT` per `ITEMID` at the `'control'` site; cross-project). Profiled the join: **`ITEMID` = `consumable_sku`, 99.5% coverage**; cost `UNITID` matches the ledger `consumable_uom` 90.6%. Waste is valued only on UoM-matched items; the **9.4% UoM mismatches are called out per finding** (`uom_mismatch_count` + note listing the SKUs) rather than mis-valued. Real cost runs ~10× lower than the inflated placeholder (fixes the cheese case), so **re-tuned `WASTE_DAILY_THRESHOLDS`** to the observed p90/p99 per facility type (HDR 1k/3k, DISH 40k/65k, CK·PROD 15k/30k). Clean SQL + notes in `app/SCHEMA_NOTES.md`.
- **Cleanups:** disabled **XFER-01** (Pavel: transfer orders out of scope). **Deferred the `LOWER()` case pass** — profiled the join keys (26,851/26,922 exact, **0** case-only matches), so it's a no-op-with-cost today; revisit right after Johnny's UoM standardization, which is the likely source of case drift.
- Reseeded live (BigQuery + Jira): 67 exceptions across 6 rule types; tests 5/5.

### 2026-06-10 — Phase 5 start: React rebuild of the console (runs locally, live data)
- Began the production UI rebuild as a **Vite + React + TypeScript** app at `app/frontend-react/`, so the user can run it locally with hot-reload while making visual changes / testing new rules. **Reuses the approved `styles.css` verbatim** (identical look) and hits the **same** FastAPI API; the vanilla console under `app/frontend` is left untouched.
- Installed **Node 24 LTS standalone** (`~/.local/bin/node`, no admin — brew is permission-broken). `npm run dev` serves :5173 and **proxies `/api` → :8000**, so it runs against live BigQuery + Jira.
- **Ported this iteration:** app shell (brand, topbar with live **Run validation** / **Sync from Jira**, sidebar nav with open-count badge), **Reporting Dashboard** (KPIs, SVG trend, system donut, by-type/facility/movement/severity bars, recurring leaderboard — all with dashboard→workbench drill-down), **Exception Workbench** (search + 8 filters incl. Primary owner, sortable 14-col grid, drill chip), and a **read-only detail drawer** (snapshot with `$0.00`/`NULL` price formatting + began/detected/last-receipt line, ownership, timeline, the rule that fired, live over-receipt breakdown).
- **Verified** headless against live data: shell + KPIs (37 open / 3% SLA, matches backend), donut + 13 type bars, 37 workbench rows with correct columns, drawer opens — **zero console errors**. Visually faithful to the approved design.
- **Next:** Turnaround/SLA + Rule & Routing Admin screens; wire drawer **write actions** (status/reassign/hand-off/resolve) to the API; then Entra SSO + RBAC. At deploy, build the React `dist` and have the container serve it (replacing the static vanilla console).

### 2026-06-10 — "Errors by movement type" now driven by ledger l1/l2 action
- Per the user, the dashboard's movement breakout is keyed on the **ledger `l1_action` / `l2_action`** (the real movement vocabulary: Add/Remove/Move/Adjust/Revise/System/Correction/Cycle Count/…), not an errorType heuristic. Profiled the column (10 distinct values; `Remove` 144M dominant).
- The over-receipt finder now captures the **receiving action of the largest receipt** (`ANY_VALUE(l1_action HAVING MAX q)` / `l2_action`) into each ledger-sourced error's snapshot as `movement`. PO-table-only errors (PO-09 missing price) have no ledger movement → bucketed as **"Non-Movement Errors"** (user's label). `movementOf()` (React + vanilla) now reads `snapshot.movement || "Non-Movement Errors"`.
- Current 37 bucket as **Add / PO Receipt 26 · Add / Received 1 · Non-Movement Errors 10** — the breakout enriches as ledger-movement rules (negative on-hand, transfer/move, adjustments) are added. Re-seeded; backend tests green; React QA 35/35.

### 2026-06-10 — React rebuild brought to full prototype parity
- After review feedback (the first React drawer was a read-only stub — missing Notes, colored timeline dots, and the status/reassign/hand-off action flow), did a **full feature audit** of the vanilla prototype and closed every gap.
- **Bug fixed:** the drawer never opened in the browser — it used `.drawer.open`, but the approved CSS reveals it via `.drawer.show` (it rendered off-screen). Caught because the original headless check only asserted DOM presence, not on-screen visibility.
- **Ported to parity:** drawer (full ownership w/ hand-off box, colored JIRA/ownership timeline `.tdot`, Notes + input, full over-receipt breakdown table w/ UoM/duplicate warnings, and the wired action footer — status `<select>`→transition, Open-in-JIRA, Reassign owner, Hand off…, Add note); Workbench row selection + bulk bar (reassign/comment/resolve/clear); **Turnaround/SLA** screen (aging buckets, by-team/owner/holder, overdue); **Rule & Routing Admin** (rules + enable toggles, rule editor, routing map, SLA targets); keyboard shortcuts (1–4, /, Esc); refresh-after-mutation.
- **QA:** a **34-point headless feature test** (`/tmp/qa_react.py`) now checks actual on-screen visibility + every screen/control — all green, zero console errors; `tsc --noEmit` clean. Notes stay local-mock (matching the prototype); real Jira-comment wiring is a small backend add if wanted.

### 2026-06-10 — Phase 1 start: production foundation (Docker · CI · Postgres parity)
- Began hardening for deployment **without changing the local code-edit loop** (the user keeps editing validations in code, not a UI — [[wonder-rules-in-code-not-ui]]). All three pieces need no cloud creds and are CI-provable.
- **Containerized:** `app/Dockerfile` (single image = FastAPI API + static console, build context `./app`) + `.dockerignore`. CMD runs `alembic upgrade head` then uvicorn; honors Cloud Run's `$PORT`.
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with three jobs — **Tests (SQLite)**, **Migrations + lifecycle (Postgres 16 service container)** (real round-trip: `alembic upgrade head` + the full pytest lifecycle on Postgres), and **Docker build**. Added `requirements-dev.txt` (runtime + pytest).
- **Postgres parity:** introduced **Alembic** (`alembic/`, env wired to `settings.app_db_url` + the models' metadata; `render_as_batch` for SQLite). Initial migration `d43ff7a17b74` creates all 7 tables. `db.init_db()` now `create_all`s only on SQLite; Postgres/prod schema is owned by Alembic (`alembic upgrade head`). `docker-compose.yml` runs the console on Postgres locally (fixtures + memory sink by default — no creds).
- **Verified locally:** migration applies cleanly on a fresh SQLite DB (7 tables + `alembic_version`); renders valid **Postgres DDL** offline (`SERIAL`/`JSON`/sized `VARCHAR`) — dialect-compatible; tests green (3 passed). The full Postgres round-trip + image build run in CI on push (couldn't run a local Postgres — Homebrew is permission-broken, see [[homebrew-installed]]).
- **What's next (Phase 1 cloud, needs access):** Terraform for Cloud Run + Cloud SQL + Secret Manager (scaffold-then-apply with the user's GCP project); wire the GitHub repo's Actions to deploy. Then Phase 5 (React rebuild, Entra SSO/RBAC).
- **CI verified green via `gh`** (installed standalone at `~/.local/bin/gh`, authed as MDietrichWork). First run caught a real bug — bare `pytest` couldn't import `wonder` (cwd not on `sys.path`); fixed with `app/backend/pytest.ini` (`pythonpath = .`). Re-run `27290449336`: all three jobs green, including the **real Postgres round-trip** (`alembic upgrade head` + lifecycle on a Postgres 16 service container) and the Docker build.

### 2026-06-10 — Phase 1 cloud: Terraform scaffold (Cloud Run + Cloud SQL + Secret Manager)
- `infra/terraform/` provisions the console on GCP: **Cloud Run** (the `app/Dockerfile` image), **Cloud SQL for Postgres** (app DB; container runs `alembic upgrade head` on boot), **Secret Manager** (`APP_DB_URL` incl. password, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`), **Artifact Registry**, a least-privilege **runtime SA**, and **read-only BigQuery** (`bigquery.jobUser` + `dataViewer` on the source project). Fully parameterized via `variables.tf` / `terraform.tfvars.example`; secrets come from `TF_VAR_*` env, never committed.
- **Validated, not applied** — installed Terraform standalone (`~/.local/bin/terraform` 1.15.6), `terraform init` (downloaded Google provider ~>6.0) + `terraform validate` → **"configuration is valid"**, `fmt` clean. Applying needs a GCP project + creds (go-live: Wonder's project). `.gitignore` updated to exclude tfstate/`.terraform`/`terraform.tfvars`.
- **Go-live hardening noted in the TF README:** GCS state backend (state holds secrets), `allow_unauthenticated=false` + IAP/Entra SSO, Cloud SQL private IP + REGIONAL HA + PITR + deletion protection, and retargeting `project_id`/`bq_project` to Wonder's project.

### 2026-06-10 — Waste: implausible-qty rule (Jira) + daily waste-$ dashboard card
- Split waste handling two ways, per the user. **Cost model:** per-consumable-SKU unit cost = `supplier_price` when `supplier_uom = consumable_uom`, else `supplier_price × supplier_sku_qty / consumable_sku_qty` (converts supplier-unit price → consumable-unit price). Waste set = `Lost, Missing Items, Expiration, Damage, Recall, Recall Production, DISH…Damaged` (Shelf Life Extension excluded — it *extends* life, not a loss; counting actions excluded).
- **`WASTE_IMPLAUSIBLE_QTY` rule (High → SC Product (IMS)):** a single (sku, location, day) waste quantity **> 100,000 units** (`adjust_implausible_qty` config) → **Jira ticket**. These are physically-impossible quantities (e.g. CK1's `9,000,668`-unit tin = the SKU number leaking into the qty field). Distribution check: only 41 sku-location-days in 14d exceed 100k, 3 exceed 1M. Ledger-sourced (`Adjust / <reason>` movement); per-(sku,loc,day) auto-close when corrected. Fixtures `_range`/`_referential` handlers guarded to skip BQ-only rules.
- **Daily waste-$ dashboard card (NOT tickets):** `waste_by_location()` sums daily waste valued at unit cost, **excluding** the implausible rows, and flags locations over **$10,000/day** (`daily_waste_threshold_usd`). Computed live per run_date, cached in `/bootstrap` (`wasteByLocation`), resilient. New React Dashboard card. Current: West Chester $96,501 (8 SKUs) · CK1 $74,856 (32 SKUs) — both genuine waste.
- Re-seeded → **78 exceptions** (10 WASTE_IMPLAUSIBLE_QTY); backend tests green; React QA 35/35, zero console errors. (Vanilla console waste card still to add for parity.)

### 2026-06-10 — Over-receipt severity tiered by magnitude (5–50% High, >50% Urgent)
- Per the user, the over-receipt overage is now **severity-banded**: **5–50% over → High, >50% over → Urgent** (set `over_receipt_urgent_pct = 0.50`, which was previously defined-but-unused at 0.10). `PO_OVER_RECEIPT` severity is computed in the finder (`Urgent if over_frac > urgent else High`); the extreme **>2× tail stays split out as `PO_IMPLAUSIBLE_QTY`** (Urgent, SC Product — likely data corruption). The fixtures engine reads the same config (kept in sync; updated `test_over_receipt_severity_bands` to the new bands).
- Split the demo per-band cap (`gen_high` / `gen_urgent`) so **both** severities stay visible after the cap. Re-seeded → **68 exceptions**: PO_OVER_RECEIPT 20 (10 High @20–50%, 10 Urgent @100%); overall High 40 / Urgent 28. Tests green.

### 2026-06-10 — Live rule XFER-01: pick against a non-existent Transfer Order
- Added **XFER-01** — a Transfer Out pick (`ref_order_type='Transfer Order'`, `l2_action='Transfer Out'`) whose `ref_order_id` isn't in the **transfer-order population** (the orders table holds them as `order_type='Transfer'` — 573k transfer orders). New error type **TRANSFER_ORDER_MISSING** (High / Hard) → **SC Product (IMS) / Sarah Chen** (component *Transfer Orders*).
- **Fires live: 14 orphan transfer orders** in the 14-day window (capped to 10). The orphans use a `DISH_DTC…` id scheme vs the synced `PO-…` ids — a real source-sync gap. Ledger-sourced, movement `Remove / Transfer Out` → **adds the first non-receipt slice to the movement chart** (Add/PO Receipt 38 · Remove/Transfer Out 10 · Non-Movement 10).
- Finder + routing + ticketing + per-`to_id` auto-close (`recheck_to_exists`). Re-seeded → **58 exceptions**; tests green.
- **Data note (Pavel's 4-leg transfer model):** XFER-01 only checks *order existence*. The deeper transfer-integrity check (origin → ghost/in-transit "Transfer WHSE" → destination, quantities must balance) is a separate rule — profiled **40,536 transfers with net qty ≠ 0 in 14d** (units stranded/lost in transit). That's the TRANSFER_WAREHOUSE_IMBALANCE / catalog XFER-06 rule, not yet built.

### 2026-06-10 — Live rule PO-14: received SKU not on the PO (3-way match, catalog PO-02)
- Added **PO-14** — a `consumable_sku` received against an **existing** PO (ledger `ref_order_id` = PO `po`, `order_type='Purchase'`) that **isn't on the PO's lines**. New error type **PO_SKU_NOT_ON_PO** (High / Hard), routed to **SC Product (IMS) / Marcus Webb** (component *3-Way Match*).
- **Fires on live data: 132 in the 14-day window** (capped to 10 tickets); `po_missing_entirely = 0` reconfirmed (PO always exists, so this is purely the SKU-membership break). Ledger-sourced → carries the receiving `l1/l2` movement (`Add / PO Receipt`), so it feeds the movement chart.
- Full pipeline: SQL finder (`_sku_not_on_po`) + routing + ticketing + per-(po,sku) auto-close (`recheck_sku_on_po` — closes once the SKU appears on the PO). Guarded the fixtures `_referential` handler to skip BQ-only rules (empty params). Re-seeded → **47 exceptions** (10 each: UoM, over-receipt, missing-price, SKU-not-on-PO; 7 implausible). Backend tests green; React QA 35/35.

### 2026-06-10 — Safety-net rule: PO-13 null PO number in the master table
- Added **PO-13 — `order_type='Purchase' AND (po IS NULL OR TRIM(po)='')`** on the PO master table. New error type **PO_MISSING_NUMBER** (Urgent / Hard), routed to **SC Product (IMS) / Marcus Webb** (component *PO Master Integrity*).
- **Finds 0 on current data** (the `po` column is populated on all 18.8M rows) — wired anyway at the user's request as a **safety-net**: full finder + routing + ticketing + per-`_id` auto-close (`recheck_null_po`, closes once a PO number is set), so if upstream ever degrades it'll ticket + self-heal like the other rules. Fixtures engine skips it (`po` not in the logical map).
- Registered without a re-seed (upserted the Rule + RoutingMap into the live DB) to avoid Jira churn — current 37 tickets untouched; backend tests green; finder dry-run = 0.

### 2026-06-10 — Second live rule: PO-09 vendor price missing
- **Broadened the live rule catalog beyond over-receipt.** Until now only PO-03 (over-receipt) fired on real data; everything in the demo rode on one rule. Added **PO-09 — `order_type='Purchase' AND (supplier_price IS NULL OR supplier_price = 0)` AND `UPPER(status)='CLOSED'`** (a *finalized* PO that was never priced — a definite defect, not a still-in-progress draft). New error type **PO_MISSING_PRICE** (Urgent / Hard), routed to **Procurement / Tom Becker**, JIRA component *Vendor Pricing*. The demo now spans **4 rule types across 4 owners** (over-receipt, implausible qty, UoM mismatch, missing price).
- **Why it matters:** ~130k all-time *closed* Purchase lines lack a usable vendor price — a closed receipt can't be costed into the GL without one. A clean, deterministic, single-table check; a genuinely new owner/category the console didn't surface before.
- **Detail drawer** shows the PO-side fields the user asked for: `po`, `system` (= `po_source_system`), `order_type`, `po_date_utc`, `supplier_name`, `supplier_sku`, `supplier_sku_name`, and `supplier_price` (rendered as `$0.00` / `NULL`).
- **Wiring:** `bq_finder._missing_price` + `_build_price_sql` (single PO-table scan, `maximum_bytes_billed` cap, age anchored to `po_date_utc`), registered in `_FINDERS`; `recheck_price` closes a ticket once a vendor price is set; `validate.py` BQ auto-close now **dispatches per rule** (over-receipt family vs. price). The fixture engine skips BigQuery-only rules whose column isn't in the logical map. Re-seeded against live BQ + a clean Jira project (37 tickets: 10 over-receipt / 7 implausible / 10 UoM / 10 price); tests green (3 passed); headless check: new type in catalog + filters, drawer renders the PO snapshot, zero JS errors.
- **Feasibility note for the rest of the catalog:** production / transfer / sales / BOM / cost rules need tables not yet wired; `correction_ref_id` is universally NULL (PO-11 out); Move pairing lacks a clean key. Next viable live candidates from the two tables we have: **stale POs (PO-07/08)** — no-receipt / partial past expected date (~20.8k open, but historical-heavy) — and (heavier) negative on-hand via a cumulative window.

### 2026-06-10 — Data-derived SLA anchor (breach date, not batch-detection date)
- **Age / SLA now start when the error actually began in the data, not when the nightly batch caught it.** The over-receipt finder gained an `evt` CTE with a running cumulative received-qty per (po, sku) and a `breach` CTE that pinpoints the **first receipt at which cumulative received crossed the ordered threshold** = the breach date. UoM-mismatch anchors to the **first receipt in the conflicting unit**. `validate.py` stores that as the Error's age anchor (`first_run_date`), while `detected_at` keeps the real detection timestamp.
- **Why breach date, not last-receipt** (decided with the user): last-receipt resets the clock on every new delivery, hiding chronic problems; breach date = true inception, so the **oldest unfixed breaches surface first** and you can drill by severity × age. Last-receipt is kept as a separate *staleness* signal.
- The drawer now shows the full timeline — **"began {breach} · detected {run} · last receipt {last}"** — and the dashboard's "New today" switched to *detected*-today (so it still means newly-flagged).
- **Effect on the live demo:** ages now spread **1–14 days** across the backfill (was a flat 0d), the aging buckets, held-time, and the overdue list all populate realistically (25 of 27 breaching — the aged backlog the backfill is meant to expose). Re-seeded against live BigQuery + a clean Jira project; lifecycle tests green (3 passed).
- **⏳ DEPLOYMENT TODO — exact breach age:** today the breach date is bounded by the 2-week backfill window and the running cumulative is summed only within that window, so a PO that first over-received 20 days ago reads as ~14 days old (clamped to the window edge) and the crossing point is computed on a partial sum. At go-live we need the **true, exact age**: the one-time backfill must sweep **far enough back (or unbounded) per PO** and compute the running cumulative over the **PO's full receipt history**, not just the lookback slice, so the breach date is the real first crossing. (Cost trade-off: a wider/unbounded scan bills more bytes — likely a per-PO history pull or a materialized cumulative rather than a blanket window widen.) Two open questions to settle with the team before go-live (also in PLAN.md → Open items):
  - **Backfill depth (X)** — how far back the initial sweep goes (drives catch-up size + the exact age we can compute).
  - **Daily reconciliation window** — re-check only the previous day, or a trailing N-day window to catch **late-posted receipts**? Also sets how far back the daily cumulative must sum for a touched PO's true running total.

### 2026-06-10 — Accountability queue + SLA-by-holder views
- **Accountability queue (primary owner).** New **Primary owner** filter on the Exception Workbench shows everything a person is accountable for — *including tickets they've handed off*. The SLA "By owner" table is now keyed on the primary owner (accountable, never moves on hand-off), gained a **Handed off** column, and each name is **clickable → opens that owner's full accountability queue** in the workbench.
- **SLA-by-holder (held-time).** New **"By holder"** table on the Turnaround/SLA screen, keyed on whoever *currently holds* each open ticket: Holding · Handed-to-them · Breaching · Avg held · Total held-days. Held-time is attributed to the current holder while the SLA clock still belongs to the primary owner and does not reset. Clicking a holder drills the workbench to the tickets they're holding. Verified: Tom Becker (a non-owner who received a hand-off) correctly appears as a holder with his handed-off count.
- Frontend-only (`index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`) — the contract already exposed `primaryOwner`/`currentHolder`/`heldDays`. Headless check: zero JS errors, both tables render, owner-row click lands on a pre-filtered workbench.
- **Note:** with BigQuery as the source the demo seed is a single backfill sweep, so held-time/aging/trend read 0 until data spans multiple days (the views are correct; the seed is flat).

### 2026-06-10 — Phase 4: Jira → app sync (poller)
- **Two-way now closed.** A poller (`wonder/jobs/sync_jira.py`, `POST /api/sync`, ⟲ Sync-from-Jira button, or CLI) reads Jira (`labels = wonder-dq` via JQL) and reconciles changes made **directly in Jira** back into the app: status moves (To Do/In Progress/In Review/Done → Open/In Progress/In Review/Resolved), and **resolution → turnaround from the real Jira `resolutiondate`**. Verified: moving a ticket to In Progress / Done in Jira → the console reflects it (status, resolved date, turnaround) with a `jira-sync` timeline entry; reopening clears resolved_at.
- **Assignee sync intentionally deferred** — in a single-user sandbox the Jira assignee never matches the fictional routed names, so syncing it false-flags every ticket. Needs real Jira users mapped to the owner model + last-known-assignee tracking (production). Status sync is the valuable, unambiguous part and is on.
- Centralized the status vocabulary in `wonder/status_map.py` (APP↔Jira both directions).
- **Sync direction & cadence (decided 2026-06-10):** **App → Jira is real-time/synchronous** — resolving, transitioning, reassigning, or handing off in the console pushes to Jira on the click, and resolving stamps `resolved_at` immediately so turnaround/SLA end at that instant. **Jira → app stays on the manual `⟲ Sync from Jira` button for now** (the user opted to leave it manual). **⏳ DEPLOYMENT TODO: replace the manual poller with a Jira webhook** (Jira pushes changes → instant Jira→app sync) once we have a public endpoint at deploy time; a scheduled background poll is the fallback if a webhook isn't feasible.

### 2026-06-10 — JIRA automation live (real Jira Cloud sandbox)
- Connected the **real Jira Cloud REST adapter** to a sandbox site (`dietrichcoding.atlassian.net`, project **KAN**) via API token in `.env`. Proven end-to-end: **create → route → fingerprint-label → dedup on re-run (0 duplicates) → auto-close via the Done transition.**
- **Ticket formatting cleaned** (human-readable, not app-only): **priority mapped to severity** (Urgent→Highest / High→High / Medium→Medium / Low→Low), **summary = `error_type // entity_key`**, and a **readable description** (labelled bullet list of the key facts + fingerprint) instead of raw JSON. Create is resilient (drops `priority`/`components` and retries if a team-managed project rejects them).
- **Console wired to real Jira:** re-seeded the demo to **27 real tickets** (10 over-receipt / 10 UoM-mismatch / 7 implausible), and the in-app "Open in JIRA" links (grid + drawer) deep-link to the real issues (`meta.jiraBaseUrl`). Demo cap = 10/band (tunable); `↻ Run validation` now runs the daily batch against Jira.
- **Owner-team linking:** created 5 Jira groups (`dq-field-ops` / `dq-sc-product-ims` / `dq-procurement` / `dq-accounting` / `dq-hdr-field-ops`, via `wonder.jira_admin`); each ticket gets the **assignee** set (accountId, mapped per team via `JIRA_TEAM_MAP`; default = the JIRA_EMAIL user) and a **team label** so Jira filters by owner team. Dropped the `components` field. Routing verified: 10 Field Ops / 10 Procurement / 7 SC Product.
- **In-app actions push to Jira:** from the exception drawer you can change **status** (Open / In Progress / In Review / Resolved — app wording mapped to Jira To Do / In Progress / In Review / Done, transitions the real issue), **reassign owner**, **hand off**, and **mark resolved**. Status filter is data-driven.
- **Ownership-transfer (hand-off) model:** every exception has a **primary owner** (accountable, never changes on hand-off, holds the SLA) and a **current holder** (who's actively working it). "Hand off…" sets the current holder (Jira assignee → holder, comment posted), keeps the primary owner, records the hand-off in the timeline, tracks **"held N days"**, and **does not reset the SLA** — so the primary can keep tabs on how long the holder has had it. (e.g. Diego (primary) → Tom (holder); Diego stays accountable.)
- **For production:** point `JIRA_BASE_URL`/token at the company Jira + a real project, have an admin add an `Urgent` priority (then flip the mapping 1:1) + create the owner-team groups, set per-team `assignee_email`, and raise the cap.

### 2026-06-09 — Live BigQuery connection + first real validation
- **Connected to production BigQuery** (`wonder-dw-prod-brd.inventory`) read-only via the user's own ADC login (gcloud installed to home dir + standalone Python 3.12, no sudo/admin). Mapped the real schema in [`app/SCHEMA_NOTES.md`](app/SCHEMA_NOTES.md).
- **Profiled the real data** (capped, single-partition queries): ledger **186.4M rows / 84 GB** (partitioned daily by `datetime_utc`, clustered by `system_of_origin`); PO table **18.8M rows / 5.6 GB** (unpartitioned). Real vocab: systems Pantry/Shiphero/Fishbowl/System; facility_type HDR/DISH/PRODUCTION; PO receipt = `ref_order_type='Purchase Order'`.
- **Findings that reshape the rules:**
  - **Null-PO (PO-01) and PO-missing (PO-02) find ZERO** on real data — the pipeline enforces PO references. Correct rules, nothing to flag.
  - **Over-receipt (PO-03) fires: 42,280 PO lines received >5% over ordered (36,077 >10%).** It is the right first live rule (and exactly what Pavel suggested on the call).
  - **Data-corruption discovery:** the most extreme over-receipts are corrupt `received_qty` values (e.g. ordered 7, received 7×10²⁰) — a distinct, serious upstream defect, separate from genuine receiving overages.
- **Architecture change:** at this scale the engine can't fetch tables into Python — added a **BigQuery SQL-pushdown finder** (`wonder/rules/bq_finder.py`) that returns only offending rows, with a `maximum_bytes_billed` cap on every query.
- **Corrected over-receipt logic (per Pavel) + proper daily batch.** Join **ledger `ref_order_id` → PO `po`**; item link is **`consumable_sku`** on both tables (not `ims_sku`); compare **SUM(`consumable_quantity_change`)** received vs **`consumable_sku_qty`** ordered; ledger rows filtered to **`ref_order_type='Purchase Order'`** and PO rows to **`order_type='Purchase'`**. `consumable_uom` is surfaced on both sides. **UoM mismatches are split into their own category `PO_UOM_MISMATCH`** (Procurement / UoM-Conversions) and excluded from the over-receipt % — since e.g. ordered 4 gal vs received 512 floz is the *same* volume, not a 12,700% overage. This dramatically cleaned the over-receipt buckets (a 2-week backfill: 385 UoM-mismatch / 26 genuine over-receipt / 7 implausible). Next refinement: a conversion-reconciliation rule that applies the conversion factor and only flags mismatches that *don't* reconcile. The daily batch flags **POs that received on the run-date partition**, comparing their **cumulative** received-to-date (90→30-day lookback) vs ordered. Emitted as two UI-filterable populations: **`PO_OVER_RECEIPT`** (genuine ≤2× → High, Field Ops) and **`PO_IMPLAUSIBLE_QTY`** (received >2× → Urgent, SC Product (IMS) / Data Integrity).
- **Console wired to live data** (`DATA_SOURCE=bigquery`), replaying 14 daily batches → **71 accumulated real over-receipts** (28 genuine / 43 implausible) with a real 14-day trend. Facility/system **filters + charts are now data-driven** (derive from the actual exceptions), so they show real Wonder facilities (CK1, Arcadia, Media…) and systems (Fishbowl/Shiphero/Pantry). Notable real signal: many genuine catches are **received = exactly 2× ordered** → likely double-logged receipts. Auto-close is correctly **disabled for the scoped BigQuery run** (a touched-subset run can't infer "fixed" from absence). The Admin → PO-03 **Expression box shows the runnable daily-batch SQL**. Verified in-browser: filter Error type → `PO_OVER_RECEIPT` isolates the genuine overages; donut totals 71; **zero console errors**.
- **Two-phase operating model (per Pavel):** a one-time **backfill** that catches the whole existing backlog (365-day sweep; caught **5,915** over-receipts, ticketed ~1,500 balanced across genuine + implausible via per-band ranking so corrupt rows don't crowd out genuine ones), then the **daily batch** going forward (POs that received on the run-date partition, cumulative received vs ordered). **Auto-close for the live rule is a per-ticket resolution re-check**: each run re-evaluates every *open* ticket's specific (po, consumable_sku) against current data and closes it (→ Jira Done) only if it genuinely passes now (received within tolerance AND UoMs agree) — so a DE upstream fix auto-closes the affected tickets, with no false closes (verified: 0 closed when nothing changed). Seeded as backfill + 7 daily runs → ~1,523 live exceptions + an 8-point trend (big backfill bar, then small daily increments).
- **"Why this flagged" drawer visual:** clicking an over-receipt fetches a live PO-line-vs-ledger-receipts breakdown (`/api/exceptions/{pk}/breakdown`, cluster+date-pruned) and shows each receipt's qty + `l1`/`l2` action + facility + timestamp, with an auto **duplicate-receipt warning** when ≥2 identical `Add`/`PO Receipt` events exist. Confirms the dominant defect is double-logged receipts (e.g. FB-2126: two `Add/PO Receipt` of 36, 33s apart → 72 vs 36 ordered).
- **Filters/charts are data-driven** (facility, system, donut, bars derive from the actual exceptions), so they show real values regardless of source.
- **Tunables for the touchpoint:** tolerance (5%), the 2× genuine/implausible split, cumulative lookback windows (daily 30d / backfill 365d), severities, and the per-band caps — all easy to adjust against what the filtered UI shows.

### 2026-06-09 — Phase 1–2: working application (validation engine + live console)
- Built a **runnable full-stack vertical slice** under [`app/`](app/README.md) — one command (`./run.sh`) seeds 21 daily validation runs and serves the console at `:8000`. Python 3.9, FastAPI + SQLAlchemy (SQLite locally, Postgres-ready), zero external setup by default.
- **Validation engine + lifecycle:** rule primitives `NOT_NULL`, `REFERENTIAL`, `RANGE`, `OVER_RECEIPT` (PO-03/04 bands), `RECON_TRANSFER`, seeded from the framework catalog (PO-01/02/03, TWH-01, COMPLETE-02). Full **detect → fingerprint → dedup → route → create/auto-close** loop with recurrence counting; **idempotent** re-runs (no duplicate tickets); **auto-close** when an issue stops reproducing (verified: fixed-earlier + fixed-today cases).
- **Swappable adapters** so going live is config, not a rewrite: `DataSource` (bundled **fixtures** ⇄ **BigQuery**, read-only, column-mapped via `schema_map.py`) and `TicketSink` (**in-memory** ⇄ **Jira Cloud REST v3**: create + fingerprint label + auto-close transition).
- **API + console:** FastAPI serves `/api/bootstrap` (the exact data contract the approved console already consumes) plus `run`, `assign`, `subassign`, `resolve`; the approved console is wired to it (live data, drill-down, ownership/sub-assignment drawer, **↻ Run validation** button, real assign/resolve). Severities aligned to the locked **Urgent/High/Medium/Low** SLA model.
- **Verified:** engine + lifecycle pytest (3 passing, incl. auto-close + idempotency); end-to-end Playwright drive of the live app — all four screens render real validated data with **zero console/runtime errors**; `/api/run` idempotent; assign/resolve/sub-assign persist.

> ⚠ Process note: the locked rule was *mockups before production code*; the mockup direction was approved 2026-06-09, so this app build is the sanctioned start of Phases 1–2. It runs on fixtures until the BigQuery/Jira credentials above are supplied.

### 2026-06-09 — Phase 0: Direction approved; consolidated prototype built
- **Walkthrough outcome (Mike ⇄ Pavel):** move forward with **Variant A as the base, blended with Variant C's dashboard-led concept**; Variant B (inbox) rejected. Pavel liked A's *condensity* and a *darker-blue* scheme; wanted the **reporting dashboard to be the home screen** and A's **Exception Workbench** kept as-is.
- **Built `prototypes/approved-console/`** (new self-contained folder; the three original variants are kept in-repo as reference, untouched):
  - **Reporting Dashboard is now the landing screen** (A's standalone Home removed). Variant C's KPI tiles + charts ported into A's tight card density: 5 clickable KPI tiles, dual-line **error trend** (flagged vs auto-closed, 21 days), **by system** donut, **by type / by facility / by severity** bars, and a recurring-error leaderboard with rising/falling trend icons.
  - **New breakout: "Errors by inventory movement type"** (Pavel's explicit ask — PO Receipt / Transfer / Production / Sales / Expiration / Adjustment).
  - **Drill-down:** clicking any KPI / chart / donut segment / leaderboard row opens the Exception Workbench pre-filtered, with a removable "Drilled from dashboard" chip.
  - **Ownership / sub-assignment concept** added to the detail drawer (clearly marked *under review*): primary-owner + sub-assignee fields, "Assign to person" and "Sub-assign to team" mock actions, an ownership-transition entry in the timeline, and a note that the **original SLA does not reset** and moves to whoever holds it (audit-trail framing). SLA "Overdue" table gains a *Sub-assigned to* column.
  - Retuned to the **darker-blue** dark theme; kept A's dense spacing, keyboard shortcuts (1–4, /, Esc), filters, bulk actions, and admin.
- **Verified** with the Playwright/Chromium harness (`~/.wonder-tools-venv`): all four screens render, drill-down + chip work, drawer shows ownership/sub-assignment with the SLA-not-reset note, dashboard charts (movement/donut/dual-line/leaderboard) all populate — **zero console/runtime errors**.

### 2026-06-08 — Phase 0: Feedback iteration (pre-socialization)
- **Variant A:** clarified the Exception Workbench "Recur" column — renamed to **Recurrence**, added header + per-cell tooltips explaining it (times the same error recurred in 30 days), and added right padding so it isn't flush to the edge.
- **Variant B fully reworked.** The earlier guided-triage design read as too "cartoony" (emoji, warm playful theme). Replaced it with a new **light, professional 3-pane Inbox + Detail** design in `prototypes/variant-b-inbox/` (folders → exception list → full detail panel; monochrome inline-SVG icons; **no emoji**). Old `variant-b-guided-triage/` removed.
  - Fixed a runtime bug (`data.js` declared `const DATA` but `app.js` read `window.DATA`) by exposing `window.DATA`.
  - Made the **Auto-closed** folder showcase the flagship auto-close feature: added 3 recently-auto-closed exception records linked to their tickets (WIQ-1027/1031/1002); kept dashboard run-breakdowns and folder counts consistent (open 21, auto-closed 3) by excluding historical auto-closed from the current-run breakdowns and making My-team/Recurring folders open-only.
- Re-verified both variants with the Playwright harness: all screens render, **zero console/runtime errors**.
- Set up a headless QA workflow (Playwright/Chromium via `~/.wonder-tools-venv`) used to click through and screenshot prototypes.

### 2026-06-08 — Phase 0: Mockups built
- Established the project plan (mockup-first; daily batch validation; BigQuery source; Cloud SQL app DB; Python/FastAPI + React; Entra ID SSO; Jira Cloud with webhook+polling; hybrid routing; auto-close on re-validation). Full plan: `~/.claude/plans/i-will-be-creating-delegated-jellyfish.md`.
- Captured the domain model from the stakeholder walkthrough (unified ledger: systems of origin Pantry/Ship Hero/Fishbowl; facilities Infinite Kitchen/CK/DIS/Transfer Warehouse; location hierarchy; action types incl. Correction; reference order types; Transfer Warehouse balancing; Lot Expiration IDs; PO table + 3-way matching; weighted-avg cost / BOM via Cookbook↔Dynamics).
- Built **three self-contained clickable HTML prototypes** under `prototypes/` (no backend, no build step, no external dependencies — open `index.html` directly, works offline):
  - `variant-a-dense-workbench/` — information-dense data-grid / power-user direction.
  - `variant-b-guided-triage/` — guided, card-based, one-at-a-time triage for occasional/non-expert users.
  - `variant-c-dashboard-led/` — metrics/charts-first with drill-down into exceptions.
  - Each covers all four screens (exception workbench/triage, reporting dashboard, turnaround/SLA, rule & routing admin) with realistic, internally consistent sample data and demonstrates auto-created + auto-closed JIRA tickets, recurrence detection, and SLA tracking.
- Each variant lives in its own folder so the losing options can simply be deleted after selection.
- Wrote `README.md` (project overview), `prototypes/README.md` (how to open + how to choose), and this `PROCESS.md`.
- Validated all prototype JS files parse cleanly (JavaScriptCore) with no external/CDN dependencies and only local asset references.
- Set up a headless-browser QA harness (Python venv at `~/.wonder-tools-venv` + Playwright/Chromium; driver script at `tooling/shoot.py`) and drove all three prototypes end-to-end — clicking through every nav screen, screenshotting each, and capturing console/runtime errors.
  - Result: **all four screens render in every variant with zero console errors and zero runtime errors.**
  - **Bug found & fixed in Variant B:** three modal overlays were rendering on load and intercepting all clicks because `.modal-overlay { display:flex }` overrode the `hidden` attribute. Fixed with a global `[hidden] { display: none !important; }` rule in `variant-b-guided-triage/styles.css`; re-verified clean.
